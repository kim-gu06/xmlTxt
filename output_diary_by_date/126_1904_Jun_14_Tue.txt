Light N.W. & fine
cool morning ~
The S.S. Khalifah left
this morning for Basreh,
The SS. Mossul arrived
last night at 9 P.M. from
the quarantine at Gherara
where she passed ten days,
as she had six cases of
Cholera on board on her
way up ~
Alexander came in at 8 AM
riding ~ The painters came
out today to finish the
rest of the work; ~
I went with Abduljebbar Affendi
the Lawyer to consult him
about Alexander's arrangement
yesterday with the executors
appointed lawfully, Yacoob
Eassayi, & Skander Aziz
by the Widow of Shekoory
Sayegh; & the settlement
of the partnership between
them; It appears that he
does not approve of it,
it being rather risky
here after for Alexander
to recover all the credit
they have from merchants,
they may refuse payment
or detain it, but it
would be better for
1904
June
Alexander to let them
also be responsible for
half of the claim etc,
I then called on Metty
the Clerk of the Mejidish
(who remained behind
this trip on account of
the death of his Aunt
supposed by Cholera)
I saw Mikha the Tindal
there he is well now except
his speech, he cannot
talk well yet, it is an
Appoplectic stroke he got
& perhaps will never recover
his speech completely;
Alexander went down in
a goffa at 4 1/2 P.M., I
cannot go down because
my wife wants to come
in whenever I go out, so
I am going to stay in the
house to see what she
wants to do other things
with the house kit etc
At 5 P.M I called on Sister
Emilia, they took her last
night at Sister Emilia &
slept there; I also called
on Sister Eliza & came
home at 4 P.M.
Light N.W. & fine weather
