Th5. 77
Light S. Westerly
air & sultry but cool morning,
We sent the waterman to town
for provision & for letters
if any from Rezooki Sayegh
from Basreh by Mejidieh
he came back without
any letters, this is the
second time that Rezooki
has not written to me,
perhaps he is also angry
with me like his brother
on account of his mother's
leaving me ~
I called on Yousif Yaghchi
& Louisa & also on Sister
Medoola;
Weather warm & Sultry,
Light S. Westerly air ~
Everybody here & in town
have abstaining from eating
fruits, especially watermelon
melons, prunes, figs etc
& also most of the vegetables
for fear of giving them
dyarrhea, But we are
not making this strong
diet I always eat
watermelon, dates, grapes
& Other sorts of all the
vegetables ~
I took a cold bath
Light S.W. & rather calm and
warm all the night;
