Light N.W. & fine weather,
At 5 ½ AM. The S.S. Mejidieh
passed down ~
I took a cup of milk & coffee & two
half boiled eggs & some jam.
I feel better than any other
day; Alexander did not go to
town, & we put every thing to
right in the rooms
Masons come to work in
plastering the walls of the
verandah & other places;
At 10 ¾ AM the S.S. Mossul
passed up taking the opposite side
the river has risen altogether
about 4 feet;
I took for breakfast some rice
soup & a piece of cutlet & a potato
& feel alright ~
Alexander went to town at
1 P.M. on his bicycle & came
out at 5 for business ~
Mad Guilietti, Saoody
Farhat, Mons; Rouet with
Rafooli Lanton & his sisters
called on us today ~
Light N.W. & fine weather,
At 5 ½ P.M. feeling hungry I
took a cup of hot milk & coffee,
& some arrowroot & jam, but
it was too much to support
it & I felt unwell again

Mch
My stomach got huffed up &
much wind & pain came
on; In the evening Antoine Guilietti
called, & I took some arak &
soda water, at dinner I only
took a little soup but it made
me feel worse, & the whole night
I suffered from much wind
& indigestion & always inclined
to vomit & could not sleep
till two hours after midnight,
I was so upset & the wind so
full in my belly that I felt so
weak & sick ~
