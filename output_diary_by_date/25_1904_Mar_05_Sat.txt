Modte N.W. Wind and
very fine cold weather,
My bowels worked Very
loose at 2 AM ~ My Wife
also is suffering from her
indigestion ~
Masons came to work
6 persons ~
I took for breakfast some
rice soup & sucked a roasted
cutlet, with a glass of soda
water & did not feel unwell
all the day, it did me good,
At 2 P.M. Alexander came
out to us on the Bicycle, he
took tea with us, I took
some arrowroot & a cup
of milk cold & a Rusk,
& then a glass of Champagne,
I got puffed up, but no
sickness or nausea, my
bowels did not work today,
At 4 1/2 Alexander returned
to town;
Fine clear & mild weather
River is falling ~
At dinner I took only a glass
of soda water with a little of
Baghdad wine we had made of
dry raisins, & I sucked a
Cutlet, but it did me great
harm, the wind accumulated
and kept me suffering the
whole night, throwing up
an indigestible Wind & noise ~
