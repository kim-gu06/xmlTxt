Light N.W. & fine
cool morning;
At 9 1/2 am. Alexander sent
me a message to say that he
is not coming as he could
find no room in the carriage
or get a donkey ~
At 10 I called on Mr. Rosenfeld
to see about the certificate
for the sale of my house etc,
& I came home at 11;
I took a cold bath at 3 P.M
At 5 I called on Menusha
I did not feel well in talking
as at breakfast I had some
fried fish & a piece of very
small bone stuck in my throat
on the tongue & could not
get rid of it, so I left &
went to see Dr. Nezamed
Lo√Æn, he sounded my throat
with a spoon but could find
nothing, he said it must be
the place irritating & the
bone is gone down, I left
& came home, I couldnt
speak without feeling some
pricking ~
Day light n.w. & fine night,
