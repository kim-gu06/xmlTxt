The SS. Ressafah which

Left yesterday at 11 A.M
taking Troops to Amara
as there is great disturbance
among the Arabs there,
A bad day today was
the strong hot wind blew
with such violence and
brought such a thick dust
covering all the sky & the
shore on the opposite side
of the river was invisible
the house & rooms all
covered in dust my
plantation in the courtyard
are dying away from
the heat of the sun, ~
I called on Medoola at 4 P.M

& Marie, Harriette my
niece went to stay at
Sister Medoola today;
The wind kept blowing very
fresh all the time, so much I
