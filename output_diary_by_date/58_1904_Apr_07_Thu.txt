At 1 am I felt so bad &
the heartburn & wind making
so sick that I vomited
all what I had eaten in
the day time & I felt easier,
at 4 my bowels worked
loose & with lots of wind
Light n.w. & fine weather
the river is falling but very
slow about 6 inches since
yesterday ~ the canal is still
full & kept close;
The water in the desert from
above Baghdad is spreading
down & has passed toward
Gherraha, but has not
reached the road, it is
from at tent some of the
cultivation is swamped,
They have opened the mouth
of the canal today & the water
is runnnig into it from the
river, as they want to irrigate
the cucumbers & other cultivation,
I sent the watchman this
morning to Alexander to bring
us provision & medicine for
me, the nux vomiea Bella
Domea & Sovgrada mixture
to try again;
The river fell about 4 bricks
today, but the water is still
runnnig into the canal which
is open now ~
At 5 ½ P.m Alexander
Came down in a goffa; We
have discharged our Cook
Jejo today & left behind,
we have only Zekki & his
brother Hama here, &
Habooba for Cecil ~
Light S. Ely breeze & fine
mild weather;
In the evening Jeboory Yomton
his wife & sister Regina called
on us ~
The SS. Khalifah passed
down this morning at 5 ½ am
I wrote a letter to Rezooki Sayegh

I took very little food today
at breakfast & dinner, only
a piece of meat & Potato &
arrowroot, I felt better,
but I see that I have caught
Cold, my head & bones are
aching from the dampness,
I slept well & had a little wind
but no inconvenience ~
