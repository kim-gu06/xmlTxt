Modte n.w. wind & fine
I am so very weak, & have no appetite,
my stomach is still out of order,
my taste is altered, & some
wind & pain in intestines, I took
the milk & 2 raw eggs, but felt
it heavy & caused wind & pain,
Alexander went to town at
8 am. I told him to go & see Dr.
Nizam ed Din & report what I
am suffering ~
I took for breakfast some
boiled fish & hashed potatoes
with milk, but I again got,
puffed up & the wind in
the intestines & stomach begun
to trouble me all the rest
of the day ~
Alexander sent at 3 P.m. a
telegram to my wife, sent
by Ruphail her son from
Basreh, saying that he
left by Mejidieh on Tuesday
(yesterday) with the children
of his deceased sister Tookyeh,
Alexander sent me a large
bottle of the Tonic medicine
of the nux vomica, Belladonna
& Cascora Sagrada from Ezra
Daniels despensary he got it for
nothing, as I have taken more
than a dozen times, the few
doses of 5 or 6 coffee cups and
each time I had to pay 16 R. Pias
Nezam ed Din told him there
is nothing better than this for
my stomach to take ~
At about 4 P. m. I begun to
feel unwell, wind increased
& heartburn & very puffed
up, Sister medula called on
us, but I am suffering very
much, the breakfast of
boiled fish was too much
for me to take; I took in
the evening some cognac

April
with soda water, but feeling
very thirsty & took water
now with great pleasure
I never used to take before,
but the nausea & wind
increased, I lied down &
touched no food at all,
I tryed to keep myself from
vomiting, but I got worse,
at last by 12 P. m. I threw
up part of the food, & was
not quiete, still the heartburn
& acidity coming up to my
throat & irritating me
At 1 am I again vomited
all the rest & then feel quieter,
I then slept a little ~
