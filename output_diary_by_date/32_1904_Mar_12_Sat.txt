Light N.W. breeze and
fine, my bowels worked mild
last night with much wind
but I was relieved ~
At 7 ½ A.M. we all went
to Church to assist at the
Requim & Mass, I came home
as I was too weak to go to Sister
Emilia twice a day the distance
is too much for me, ~
There are no cases of Cholera
some say there are two or
three cases per day, others say
there are none, & it is not the
real Asiatic Cholera, They
have established a Cordon
all around the stations of
Baghdad of 24 hours observation
I took for breakfast soup
& little boiled meat and
some boiled fish & Potatoes,
& some Cherry Jam, and
the Pepsine & the Bismutho
magnesienne; and felt no
derangemens, ~ At 2 P.M.
I went to Sister Emilia, where
my sisters Eliza & Medoola
& my nieces & nephews also
Menusha & others were there
I returned at 4, & took some
boiled fish & some Milk
with a rusk & Pepsine ~
The S.S.Phrat arrived at
