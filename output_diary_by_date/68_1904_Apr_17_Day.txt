Saturd
Modte S. Ely breeze and
clouds all about scattered,
I do not feel well, pain & wind
still in the stomach & intestines
I have no appetite to take the
milk & eggs ~ my bowels are
working loose ~
At 8 am. my wife & I
went to hear mass at Asfars,
but Pere Louis did not come out
till 8 3/4, there were about 35
persons at Church, but some of
them did not come or were
in town, otherwise there would
have been many, at 10 we came
home; ~ I called on Kerop Effendi
Settiyan & came home ~
Alexander came down in a
goffa at 10 am;
I am suffering awfully from
pain & wind in stomach and
feel so sick, something must
have upset me yesterday perhaps
the few dates I ate at breakfast,
At 3 P.m. Alexander &
I called on the Asfars, I
1904
April
saw Jeboory, his wife & the
two children Josephina and
Albert; Yousef Georgi and
his sister Harriette, and
many other visitors came;
We left & went to call on
Fetoohi Maghak & his wife,
they are living in the little
house of Kerop Settiyan, my
wife also was there, we left
at 5, as I could not stand
longer, feeling very unwell,
with nausea & heartburn,
I lied in bed, At 6 I had
to vomit my breakfast
with my irritation, heartburn,
& pain, and it did not settle
it down, so sick was I
that I could not take
any thing at dinner time,
It is blowing very
Strong westerly wind, nearly
half a gale with clouds,
I took a little arrowroot
& turned in, but the whole night
I had the heartburn, the
stomach got very weak,
even the milk & Soda, I
could not feel inclined to
take ~
