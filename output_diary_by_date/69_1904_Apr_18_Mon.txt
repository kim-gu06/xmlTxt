Light n.w. breeze and
very fine & cold weather,
I feel so weak & have Still
the heartburn~ I took the
cup of milk & 2 eggs but
without appetite. I forced
myself to take it, as I feel so
weak; I cannot even Smoke
as I used to do before ~
At 7 Â¾ am alexander
went to town on his Bicycle,
I told to see Dr. Nezamed Din,
what he says about me,
Antone Marine called on us,
also Monseigneur J. Drure,
he came out riding & visited
all the christians out here;
Alexander sent me out with
Zekki, a bottle of the bitter Loma
of Nux Vomica, Bella Donna &
Cascara Sagrada & I took a
dose of it~ I feel little better
today; I took for breakfast
Soup made of tripe boiled
with two spoons of hatched potatoes
with milk, but I have no appetite
to eat any thing still it layd
heavy in my Stomach ~
Sister Medoola & her
husband Rezooki came
1904
April
on 1 at 10 Am on donkeys to stay
in the house, she has not come
yet this season since poor
Alice died, I went to see
her, she is putting the house
& rooms to right ~
I felt so bad that I was obliged
to go to bed, with nausea and
heartburn, inclined to vomit,
at 6 P.m. I threw up all I had
taken as soup & bread at
breakfast time, & I felt so thirsty
that I took water with pleasure
which I did not like before,
I sent the watchman to town
to bring me sweet lemon &
I sucked; Alexander came
at 6, he had seen Nezam ed
Din, he told him that this
indisposition is only temporary
it is not the former complaint,
I cannot make out the
course, either it is from eating
the few dates yesterday or
from cold or from eating
much food, as meat &
sweet things~ But I was
not relieved after vomiting
still I felt sick & the
heartburn & acidity coming
up to my throat, I ate nothing
in the evening ~ at 11 P. m.
I again vomited a good
deal of liquid stuff, sour
& bitter, & then I felt better
& was quiete, & I slept well,
