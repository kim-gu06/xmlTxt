Fresh n. w. wind and
dusty weather ~
At 6 Â½ Am my wife with
the Children of Angoorly
& servants & Kit all
went up in a goffa, as
well as two other goffa
loads, and Rufail remained
to see the Tents pulled down,
I sent to tell them
that I want my two
tents here, Rufail then
rode in at about 8 and
some people to pack the
Tents (one of Antone Marine
& two mine) ~

June
I sent my boy Hanna to
town to bring me the apples
one & half oke for making
preserves Eliza Erame
my cousin has offered to
make it for me;
I passed to my sister Medoola
& Rezooki tells me that he
was in our house before
sunset and Alexander is
doing his best to prevent his
mother from carrying away
any kit or opening rooms
& he also ordered the Indian
Watchman to prevent any
thing being taken away
while he was there, her
servant Zekki came and
went on top of the house
to unfasten my iron bed
stead to take it away
pretending that it is hers
but Alexander stopped
her & did not let her
take anything away ~
Fresh N.W. wind blowing
all the night, I could not
rig up my mosquito
curtain; ~
The river is falling fast
as the hot wind is evaporating
it;
