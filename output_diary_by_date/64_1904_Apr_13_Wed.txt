Light N.W. & fine weather,
I shifted my bed & Kit into the
big sleeping room on the
canal last night, I slept
quiete & had no wind or noise
to speak of, it must be from
not eating bread; but I took
some this morning with my
milk & eggs ~
Antone my Nephew came out
to me on his Bicycle, bringing
a letter from Major New March
addressed to his mother & me,
regarding the mortgage of
the garden of Moer Moshi
Bahar here at Cherdel Pasha
for 650 Liras, in which he
says that having sent the
Title Deeds of the Tapo to the
Waly he now returns them,
as he does not approve of
its solidity or giving any
satisfactory information,
Therefore Major New March
returns them, & if we can
find other property to be
mortgaged ~
Alexander & I called at 8 am
on Antone Marine, the Ginliettis
& Eliza & Adoola my Cousins
& came back at 11 ~
The Blacksmith Raoofy came
with a new & larger Pump
& fitted in the well, & it worked
very well, it is of 1 3/4 Moh
piping in diameter, and
I am going to fit it on to
the river, about 40 feet in
distance ~
At 3 1/2 P.m. I took some Cold
Milk, a rust & little arrowroot,
but I got the wind awfully &
the hearth burn & indigestion
At 4 Alexander & I went
to call on Seyd Dowd the
son of the late Nakib Seyd
Selman in his Kiosk,
I drunk Lemonade there
& got worse, at 6 we
came back;
The S.S. Ressafah passed
up at noon, she has been
1904
April
about 12 days on the way
up ~
I am suffering still, & I
took some dinner too as
bamia & meat etc, I am so
full of wind & pain; after
I turned in at 9 but could not
stand to lie down & felt so
inclined to vomit, at last, at 10
I threw up everything I had
taken in the afternoon & at
dinner & I felt well & slept
sound till 3 1/2 in the morning,
