mass & requiem, I then went
to the house at Eliza Erame’s

people came there were the

& Yousif the mourners; I
then went to see Monseigneur
Jean Drure, who is leaving
tomorrow morning for
Mossul in a carriage with
his secretary Pére Augustin

& came home at 11;
I took breakfast rice soup &
stewed chiken with Bamia
some Leben & fresh cheese with
5 or 6 Dates & 5 Apricots and
feel no inconveniance or

passed, my bowels working
regular since 4 or 5 days
