The river is still
rising, nearly reaching its
last rise, the Canal is
full & the water running
in ~
My stomach is not right
yet, it is weak & windy ~
my bowels worked very loose
this morning at 5, again at 6
AM. like water with lots of
wind ~
At 7 ¼ A.M. I rode in to
town, taking my servant Hanna
also with some Kit, & I locked
everything Since my Wife
is living absolutely with
Rufail in his Tents with her
servant Zekki, she wanted
me to give her only the Key
of the sitting room ~
I got home at 8, saw
Alexander & Marie there,
Alexander still complains
of the pain on his right side
& is using Dr. Nizam ed Din’s
ointment. ~
I took for breakfast chicken broth,
& the boiled chicken & some Leben;
The S.S. Ressafah left on Monday

Breeze shifting constantly
round the Compass ~

her daughter who is leaving

She could not go by the
Mejidieh last time as there
was no spare cabin,

not much puffing or
bad indigestion ~
