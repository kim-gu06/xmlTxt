Light S. Ely breeze
warm, & fine weather;
I took a cup of milk & Tea &
the two boiled eggs, then took
the 2 Pills not much
wind in stomach, but am
very weak ~ My wife went
with her servant Yekshi to
the other house of Rufail,
At 9 Alexander came in on his
Bicycle to see me only; He sent
for his Clerk Elias & ordered
for me some tender Kebab
from the bazaar, & a soup of
sheep’s feet in the evening
1904
April
to be cooked in his house ~
Alexander left again at 10 ½
to my new house ~
The SS. Khalifah left at
6 ½ AM for Basreh. ~ I
wrote no letters for anybody;
I felt again a little heartburn
& puffing in belly, but not so
bad although I took only
the milk & tea & 2 eggs this morning,
at noon I took only a few
pieces of the plain Kebab as
rosted mutton & a little
arrowroot & this increased
the wind & noise etc, ~
I soon began to feel worse and
the heartburn & wind came
on as bad as before so that
I felt very uneasy & miserable
the whole day lying
down & spitting the thick
saliva by myself in the
room, no one to assist
me; my wife never came
or sent her servant from
Rufail’s house ~ At 5
P.M. I was obliged to throw
up all what I had taken
in the shape of liquid it
was sour & bitter a great
lot & my stomach irritated
me, but the wind decreased.
Mrs. Cowly having heard
from her son Charley & daughter
Daizie yesterday they were
out to our place, that I was
unwell, sent to ask how
I was, & if I want anything
as jelly etc, I requested
her to order some jelly for
me, since nothing can
be kept in my stomach;
My wife & servant came home at
6 PM & then enquired how I was
I had ordered a soup of sheeps
feet to make me at Elias’s
house the clerk of Alexander,
he brought it, but I could eat
nothing, so I remained quiet
& only took a spoon or two of
arrowroot & slept at 9 P.M.
