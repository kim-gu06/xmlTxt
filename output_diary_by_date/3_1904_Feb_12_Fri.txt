Light N.W. & fine weather
Very mild~
The S.S. Ressafah left this
morning for Basreh ~
I feel well, no pain
but weakness, I am taking
no medicine at all, and
only the jelly & milk ~
Rezooki Andria called to see
me ~ I went to my room to
shave at noon, but nearly
fainted from weakness &
being so thin but skin & bone
The Residency Subidar
of Sepoy guard who was lost
on the night of the 28
&
no trace been found of him
in spite of the vigorous searches
made by the Turkish Detectives
His body has been found
last night, stabbed about
a dozen times & buried in
a Khan at the Owena quarter
where Paraffin is kept and
a Watchman an Afghan
who watches there. It is
reported that, three men
(Indians x Afghans) and a
Woman carrying the dead
body came at night to
this Watchman asking
him to let them stop in the Khan
with their sick mother until
the morning when they will
take her to the doctor, the
Watchman objected firmly,
but after much persuasion
he let them come in, and
as soon as they were inside,
they drew their arms and
thretened to kill the Watchman
if he says anything and
they dug a grave & burried
the Subidar in it, and
they left; The body was
brought this morning to
the Residency Doctor's house
and and examined by Dr.
Con also Nizam ed Din the
Municipality doctor,
They say that the cause of his
murder is in connection with
his going after young boys, &
that the Kawas Kheder &
the fair boy the son of Dowd

Messeyeh are connected in
it and they have already
been imprisoned ~ I heard
since the truth of the story,
that the murderers are
the whole guard of Sepoys
(24 of them) have perpetrated
the deed in their barack
(the Residency stable
behind Lynch's Khan)
that same night in which
he disappeared & after
having stabbed him with
beynots & daggers etc, they
carried the body to the beach
& took a goffa & went down
& landed at the beach of
the Nawab Ikbalood Dowlehs
house where the new
Residency is getting built
now & landed & went to
the Khan of the Paraffin
& buried it there; Among
the Sepoys there is one who
is the Nephew of the Subidar
who took part in the murder &
he is the man who divulged
the secret to Major Newmarch
It appears that the
Sepoys used to hate their
Officer & had animosity against
him for being treated badly
by him; It is not true
about the Kowas Kheder
or the son of Dowd Messeyeh
being imprisoned ~
Artin my nephew called
on us in the evening ~
The SS. Phrat arrived at
Gherrara today to make
the 5 days quarantine, but
there are no further cases of
supposed Cholera at Basreh,
I got the wind working in,
my stomach at 5 P.M. and
gradually increased so much
that at 9 I had to take the
dose of Cocain + Morphine
it allayed it very little and
I was restless all the fore
part of the night;
