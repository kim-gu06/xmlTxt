Light n.w. & fine,
The SS. Khalifah passed
down at 5 AM. ~
At 7 AM I rode in to town
on a Donkey also sent my
boy Hanna ~ I alighted
at Sister Emilia's found
her well & then I went over
to Sister Eliza, they are
all afraid of the Cholera
1904
Augst
but the mortality is not
so alarming, there are
four cases among the
Christians, perhaps one
or two daily but among
the Mahomedan + jews
certainly there are many
but I did not meet any
Coffins on the road,
The lease of H. mahmood
Pachachis house to me
is settled at 40 Liras a
year & I must make any
alterations or repairs
myself ~ at 9 I came to
my house; ~
At 10 I called on mr. Rosenfeed
at the consulate, he is also
in great way about the
Cholera, among the jews
there are some, I saw
the weekly Bulletyn of
the quarantine, putting
the attack in Baghdad
as 124 per week, at Hit
61 & all other villages
as Coot 5, & so on, but
this an error, it should
be 124 Cases daily in
Baghdad; ~ Because
the Carpenter Hassan
told me today, that in
his quarter at Oweyna
there occurs 15 to 20 cases
daily, he has had his
stepson abbossy, & his
Sister attacked but recovering
& today his uncle is
attacked~ I passed to
Alexanders Office to
see his Clerk Eelias &
came home at 11;
at 4 P. m. I went to Dr Nezam
ed Din about the pain in my
throat, he examined and
prescribed some medicine to
touch it with a cotton, as
he could see a small mark
in the throat; I took the
medicine from Ezra Daniels
& used it ~ I called on
Menusha at 4 Â½, she
is also much afraid
1904
Augst
of the Cholera ~ The Sister
of abduljebbar the Lawyer
got better & recovered
Dr Brigstocke treated
her yesterday ~ there
has been no cases today
among the Christians;
All the house in my
neighborhood are empty
their tenants have gone
out encamping, except
yousif Hamosh Tessy is
still here ~
I have a bad tooth ache
again a canine which kept
me awake all the night,
