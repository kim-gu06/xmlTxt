The SS. Mejidieh passed
down at 5 Am. followed by
the Stm Lanuch Ishtar going

We hear that Nessoory Abbood
is worse, he is too weak
although the diarrhea has
ceased; the docters give an
unfavorable report of him,
They wanted to take him
up to town, but the Boatman
refused, for fear of getting
fined, should he die
on the way up ~ they
sent for the Residency Surgeon
Dr McConaghy by whom Hannosh
went & fetched at 9 ½ to see
nessoory; I sent our servant
Hanna to enquire, they
said that he is the same
he has the real Cholera and
there a hope of one per Cent
that he recovers, he had
vomited once at night,
& the urine is suppressed,
Rezooki andria went
to town to fetch Dr Brigstock
the missionary Doctor,
Azoori Chanteduc
came out at 10 to his
Sister Menusha; ~
Nessoory Aboud died
at about 2 ½ P. m. he
became speechless and
sunk, Dr. Brigstock did
not come out to see him,
they ought to have got
him yesterday as

soon as he felt unwell,
all the Christians are in
a great consternation
and fear, But it is really
astonishing how this
malignant epidemy attacks
a person, for nessoory
is very Cautious and
had abstained from eating
everything he is sober &
Clean; Besides since the
death of Eassayis daughter
about three weeks ago, no
other case occurred in
our vicinity & none on
the opposite side, among
the Christians, the town
is getting cleaner now,
He leaves a wife Takoohy
the daughter of Reesha andria
and five Children (two sons
& three daughters) one of the
eldest daughter is married
with nassoory Eassayi,
He had inherited his
father & brothers and
must have a single
fortune of between 25
to 30,000 Liras, he was
over fifty~ His body
was taken in a carriage
to the cemetery at
Artin my nephew with
Terroza, Bella & Rosa
had come down in the Goffa
at Tantons & breakfasted
there, they called on us &
left for the town at 5 P.m.
as well as Azoori ~
We all brought our beds
down below to sleep
fearing the strong wind
& Cool nights;
The body of Nessoory Aboud
was brought to the carriage
near my house on the
canal only borne by
3 or 4 Tilkeflies & no
one with it at all except
the Priest, with no cover
on the box & drove away
at 5 ½ to the cemetery;
