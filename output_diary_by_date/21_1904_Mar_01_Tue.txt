Th6 48
Light N.W. & fine
cold morning; my bowels
worked at 3 AM briskly
I got the wind & noise & it
worked very loose; it must
be from the oatmeal I
took & a potato;
I dressed myself & got
all my Kit provisions,
furniture etc ready to
go down to my new house
The river has risen
1904
Mch
much yesterday & today;
Alexander went on his
Bicycle out early to my
new house & returned
at 7 ½ A.M. ~
I took for breakfast some
boiled fish & a piece of bread
At 1 ½ P.M. sent all my Kit
to two goffas, with a young
Calf about 8 or 9 months old
which I bought from Yacoob
Tessy for two Mejidies,
took the servants Zekki
and her brother Hanna with
me, also Juma the Coolie
carried the Kit & went down
in the goffa to land it to
my house to whom I paid
36 P & for the 2 goffas 26 P.
Rezooki Andria came down
with me to see their house
& return on donkey ~
At 1 ¾ we started & reached
our houses at 2 1/4 ~ I
found it alright, only
some of the orange trees
about 4 are dying, I
planted the two Vines
I got from Rezooki
Sayegh at Basreh they are
fine & large, the Pump is
useless, it does not give
enough water ~ Got the
rooms cleaned & arranged
some Kit, but felt so very
tyered from weakness ~
At 4 P.M. I took some more
of the boiled fish, but felt
afterward getting puffed
up & the wind coused me
an indigestion, my bowels
worked loose, but still
the wind is troubling me,
I cannot lay down, it
chokes me; ~ At 8 I took
a Cup of the bitter Tonic of the
Nux Vomica, Bella donna &
Cascara Sograda & mint water
The weather is very fine,
mild, & fine moonlight 15
days old, ~
I had much wind all the
night & coming out to my
mouth, but I slept at 9.
