I wrote a letter to Alexander
about Shekoory Sayegh’s
1904
1904
May
death & his business with him
& sent it with Rezooki Andria
My wife went to town
with Rufail & her servant
Zekki at 7 AM ~
Hassan the Carpenter & Abbas
the Khalfah came in the morning
to make the railing for the
top of the house. Also the
Blocksmiths of the Pump Raoodi
& Oussy came to fix the Pump
nearer to the door so as to work
it on the river, I bought three
Pipes of about 47 feet in all
to extend it right out to the
bank, each Pipe cost me 3 ½
Mejidies, & the Pump for 5 ¼
Liras; ~
I had rice soup & stewed potatoes &
meat with some Leben, & I felt
alright all through the day no
puffing or heartburn ~
Père Pièrre the Superior who
arrived by the Mossul from
Amara on Saturday came
out to visit the Christians here
& came to me also, he has
been away seven months &
he spent four months at
Bushire, & some time at
Mohamerah, Basreh and
Amara ~
My wife & Rufail came down
in a Goffa at 6 ½ P.M. and
they went to their Tents;
The S.S. Mossul left this morning
at 6 AM ~
I went over to Sister Medoola
to see Rezooki; he told me that
Alexander & Yousif Eassayi
have sealed the office of
Alexander & Shekoory Sayegh
today, until they settle the
Accounts, it appears that
Yousif Eassayi will be named
as executor of Shekoory’s
Account with Alexander,
I hear that Cholera has
gone to Nasseryeh & Semawa
from Basreh, & in the latter
place it is again increasing,
Light N.W. & fine clear
Weather; ~

May
I took dinner some Soup &
Cutlets with potatoes & Leben
& some Arrowroot, with Pepsine,
I turned in at 9 ½ & was alright,
but woke up at 12 & could not
sleep at all from the number
of sandflies, flees, & my tooth
ache the only one on which I
can chew; at midnight
clouds came on with thunder
& lightning & a slight shower
for ¼ hour ~
