him the garden & fine date trees
of Mahomed Said Shekhly
close below Asfar’s garden
While there, it began to thunder
& clouds came over very dark
& begun to rain, we hardly
had time to come to the river
& run to Moshi Bahar’s garden
& sheltered ourselves under
a tree but it came on so hard
& thick, we never had the
like of it this year, we were
all wet & saturated. We
run to Polus Serkis place
near the door & stayed
1904
May
there under the roof till 3 1/2
when it ceased we then
came to our places and
I had to change all my
clothes which were one mass
of water, the ground was
swampy, It then began
to open & the Wind shifted
to N.W. ~
I went to Rufail at 6 P.M. and
found his Tents all wet & the
ground very muddy, I
got them all to come and
sleep in my house himself
& the four children of his
sister, also his Sister Medoola
and her Six children and
my wife, they sent their beds
round & came after dinner
I have two rooms and
the sitting room empty,
Alexander wrote to me
saying that he is not better
but the pain on his side
is less, he sends me a bottle
of Champagne to take;
I took dinner some soup &
fried cutlets & vegetables, also
Leben & some arrowroot,
I feel well & slept well
