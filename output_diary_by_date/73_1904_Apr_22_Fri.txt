Light S. Ely breeze &
light clouds; ~
I have still the wind with pain
in the intestines & stomach, &
feel very weak ~
At 7 Am I rode in to town &
left my wife & Zekki the servant
to follow, I got home at 7:35 ~
my wife came in at 8, she
is to prepare the small house
for Rafail coming up in the
mejidieh ~
At 10 I went over to Dr. Brigstocke
at the Dispensary; He examined
& tapped my stomach, I told
him every thing which took
place & what I am suffering
from wind & heartburn
He prescribed for me 48 Pills
(24 of each Kind) to be taken
3 times a day after each meal,
one Pill of each, 2 Pills each
time & my diet to be Kept
for the present & to take
strong sheepsâ€™ feet soup,
milk, arrowroot, light tea
& milk, & little toast bread,
& to see how the Pills will act
I came home at 11 ~
I took only rice soup for
breakfast a small piece
of boiled mutton, I did
not feel today that puffing up
or inconvenience as before,
my wife went to the other small
house of Rafail with Yekki
& left me alone to do the
best I can with myself, I
made some arrowroot for me
& bought some oranges at
3 for one camarie, & an Oke
of sweet Lemon for 3 camarie,
Alexander sent Hanna the
boy to buy provisions for
him, I sent & bought me
some eggs etc by our Indian
watchman ~
Light S. Ely breeze with light
clouds & warm weather;
The English judge who
came out in the
mejedieh
Khalifah
this time to try the Sepoys
of the Residency for murder
1904
April
has condemned one the
murderer of the 5 Sepoys
& men at the Residency in
Feley as I have mentioned
it here, but has acquitted
the rest for the murder
of their Subadar a very
singular thing, there is some
object in it, as they are
all to be sent down in
the Khalifah leaving
tomorrow, it is presummed
they may be tried afresh
on arrival in Bombay,
to avoid any disturbance or
a mutiny man perhaps take
place by these Sepoys on their
way down if they are condemned
here ~
As there was nothing cooked
for me to eat my dinner and
my wife only came home after
sunset & she did not care
about getting any thing in the
shape of a Cutlet or other
nourishing food, I had to
content myself with
taking arrowroot & a piece
of dry bread, & sucked an
orange, & turned in at 8,
but I feel better, having
taken the 2 Pills & I slept
well, at midnight took
some arrowroot, I have
wind still but I am not so
puffed up, or having nausea
& inconvenience as before,
it appears that the Pills are
doing me good; it is
rather warm in the room,
& the breeze is S. Ely;
