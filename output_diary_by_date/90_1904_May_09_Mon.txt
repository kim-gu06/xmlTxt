At 6 P.M I received a
letter from Alexander with
Rezooki Andria, giving
me the sad news of the
death of Shekoury Sayegh
today at 3 ½ P.M. from
heart disease, poor
fellow he was unwell and
always complaining of
disorder in his chest
and weakness; he is about
50 years old, he leaves
his wife & two children
a son Antone of about 10
years & a younger girl
His partnership with
Alexander in the trade
by the contract they made
expired on the 1st Instant
& they were settling the
account to separate,
as Alexander was disatisfied
with the way he was
conducting business with
him; their capital was
900 Liras (600 from Alexander
& 300 from him) ~
Alexander says, that he
went with Yousif Eassayi
(Shekoory’s brother in law)
to their office & locked every
place & deposited the
keys with Kass Philippus
the Armenian Priest,
The body was interred this
evening in the cemetry;
Sister Medoola & Rezooki
called me in the evening
for an hour ~
Light N.W. fine cool

I took dinner rather heavy a
piece of cutlet, soup, fried Fasoolia
& Leben. I did not feel well
before dinner & it got very heavy
& had the heartburn all
the night & lots of wind ~
