Light Westerly breeze
and fine cool morning;
Alexander did not go to town,
We had to send the watchman
to town to fetch the Blacksmith
Oossy to come out & add
the other 14 feet tube. I
bought for 3 ½ mejideis as
the Pump has not worked
since three days, He came
at 2 ½ P.m & fixed the
tube, & it is now working
but it has more strain
to pump out on account
of the distance;
I took a cold water bath,
as well as alexander;
Modte n. W. wind &
fine weather;
