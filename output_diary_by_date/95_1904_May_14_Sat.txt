I took a warm bath at 3 P.M.
Weather warm, some clouds
hanging on, light N.W. breeze,
Alexander rode out at 5 1/2 Pm
after we took tea ~
I called on Menusha at
6 & came home at 7 ~ I
feel alright, & I think
all has passed since
6 or 7 days, I have no more
trouble with my stomach
whatever I eat or drink
no puffing up or noise
of wind in the intestines
& no nausia, I have
good appetite, I feel my
strength gaining, and
no weakness on my Knees
in walking or scaling
up stairs, I cannot
say if it is on account
of the hot weather setting
it, but most likely it
is, my bowels too is
working regular, &
I am always using
the Leben at every meal,
