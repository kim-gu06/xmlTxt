Ali Beg son of Bahram Beg
our supposed robber of our
Kit & jewellery & money of my
Wife since last week has
begun to build a second
story over his little piece of
ground next & southward
of Sister Medoola's house
& got it up in a level with
her terrace, it is a nice
little house now with the
fine little garden in it, this
piece of ground of 10 or 11
yards breadth fronting the
river which we most foolishly
left unpurchased & for the
sum of 150 Liras the length
like our 37 yards, we made
a great mistake last year
in letting it remain his
property & now we regret
1904
Mch
immensely for such a neglect,
we would have got rid
of him & his brother bad
lot as they are drunkards
and debauchers he now
overlooks both our houses
and who knows who will
hire it as he does not live
in it but it is made to be
let he must have spent
over 60 Liras more in this
last construction, & he
does not possess one Lira
as his pay & that of his brother
are not more than 3 & 2/3
Liras a month respectively,
evidently it is from our
last robbery that has now
assisted him to finish the
house ~
The new relief Sepoys
for the English Residency
36 men in all arrived this
time by the Khalifah on Sunday
last & are on duty they relieved
the Turkish zaptyes who
were guarding the consulate
The old Sepoys (12 of them
being the implicators in the
murder of their Subadar
& the other Sepoy who had
shot & killed five others
in one morning are still
in prison at the Turkish
jail pending the arrival
of the English judges from
Constantinople to be
tryed here) the rest of them
are still on duty, but carry
no arms, all will have to
be sent down to Bombay
I ate too much today at breakfast
& in the afternoon & I got the
wind awfully full in my
stomach & intestines & suffered
much at dinner I took soup
& a piece of cutlet & made
it worse, the wind so puffed
me up that I could not breath
but it passed out later on
& I slept well ~
