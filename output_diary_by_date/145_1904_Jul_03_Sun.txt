At 8 AM. I went to church, on
the road as I was walking
with Meekha the Tindal
& his son, who were at Rufail’s I
met my wife with her
servant Zekky returning
from Church going to
Rufails house, none of
us spoke ~ I called
on Menusha & on the
Guiliettis & came home
at 9 ½ AM ~
I hear that after the
arrival of the Russian Consul
general Mr. Mashkow here
he went to visit the Waly
Yesterday(the Menshir Pasha) and
it appears that he was not
received with the proper
guard of honour on alightning
except a few Zaptyes, so
1904
July
he thought it was not the
proper honour due to his
dignity & returned back
immediatly without seeing
the Mushir, although
the latter sent this aide de
camp after him to persuade
him to return & that the
desired honours will be
paid to him immedially
The Mushir sent to Mr.
Mashkow Fekhry Pasha
to arrange the matter,
&
yesterday
today Mr. Mashkow
visited the Mushir &
the proper guard was in
attendance of many Soldiers
