Light S. Ely breeze
and Cloudy weather,
Clouds are dispersed all
over; ~ Breeze shifted to
S. West at 9 am ~ But
the day remained calm &
sultry, with clouds ~
I took a Cold Water Bath;
Menusha, Harriette & Mary took
their hot bath at medoolas,
& Antone, Louis & Thomas took
a Cold bath in mine ~
Wind increased blowing
fresh all the night, and
prevented me from sleeping
