Strong S. Ely wind and
cloudy weather ~
At 4 AM my bowels worked
as ordinary with much wind,
I took in the morning a cup
of milky coffee & 2 boiled eggs,
Masons came to work,
I wrote a letter to Blockey today
by Damascus Post, informing
him of poor Alice’s death,
my illness, & the death of
poor Takoohy too & sent it
to Alexander with the watchman
I took for breakfast rice soup
& a piece of boiled meat, also a
piece of cutlet & a potato, &
then few spoons of Leben,
using the Pepsine, & then the
Bismutho magnisienne, I feel
alright & no puffing or wind
to speak of ~
Weather became very dusty,
not able to see the other side
of the river, or 20 yards distant,
At 2 P.M. my wife Marie
& Cecil with the servant
Habooba came out in the
carriage, Alexander is left
to lock every place and
see the Indian watchman

Mch
Abdulrahim who I have
engaged at 14 Besh per month
to look after the house
as Marie was very frightened
today & nearly fainting
from the news of the Cholera
in town, there are few cases
three Christians also died
from cholera yesterday &
the day before; At 5 ½ A.M.
Alexander came on the bicycle,
he locked every place in the
house & left the Indian watchman,
Our servants the cook Jejoo
& Zekki also came with
some kit in a Goffa ~
Alexander says that there
are few cases of cholera,
but those few that got
attacked were carried away
in a very short time as
Dr Nizam ed Dim told him
Weather clouded up & became
fine, with a light N. W.
breeze;
I took at dinner a plate of soup
& a rusk & some apricot jam
& felt well, I had also taken
a little arak & water, & slept
well ~
