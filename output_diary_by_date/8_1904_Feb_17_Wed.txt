Light N.W. and fine weather,
the wind pain caused by
the injection yesterday, only
subsided after midnight,
and I had very little sleep,
but I feel as if I am getting
better & stronger ~
Alexander went to tell Dr.
Nizam ed Din, he told him
that I should continue the
injection of broth & eggs, &
he cannot order any other
food for me to take except
the jelly & milk ~
Alexander went out on
his Bicycle to my house with
the fruit plants of Menusha
to plant them & also to get
other Orange and Lemon trees
planted he left at 8 AM.
I got today Hassan the
Carpenter & an other one
working at home in making
for me the glass frames &
door for the two balconies
outside in my new house,
Alice, Terrooza, Antone Marine
& Tookyeh wife of Shekoory Sayegh
called on me ~
Alexander came back from
outside at noon, he has planted
the fruit trees, but not the oranges,
At 1 P.M. he went to Kadumain
in the Tram car for business he
has with a Persian;
The SS. Phrat came up from
Gherrara this evening after having
made her five days quarantine,
But as there is no cholera
at Basreh except one suspected
case of a Jewess, the quarantine
will be taken away in a
few days ~
I made no injection
of the broth & yoke of eggs, as it caused
lots of wind & pain, & I have
had no pain all the day &
was quiete ~
Johny and Artin called in
the evening also Yacoob Tessy;
Mayor New March got a
telegram from the Consul of
Basreh saying that the
Japanese have blown up
by Torpedoes eleven Russian
Men of War, & their troops
have marched & occupied
Seoul, the capital of Korea,
I am glad to hear this news
for Russia deserves that ~

they are going too far in encroaching
on China & Korea & robbing
their countries ~
I took in the evening a dose
of the bitter mixture of Nux V
omica, Bella Donna and
Cascara Sograda, and I
did not get the pain but very
slightly, & I only could not
sleep till midnight; I am
too weak and taking nothing
but jelly & milk with Lime
water ~
