also passed up; (taking this Side)
I am suffering awfully from
my stomach, the wind is
causing great pain & my belly
is puffed up I never felt so
before, I did not touch anything
since breakfast time;
Yousif Eassayi & Shekoory

in town tonight, as he is going
to the Latin Ciroh where
there is a play taking place

Aiglon, many people are
invited, it will last till

yesterday; he says that
he could not come up by
Khalifah, but will do
so by Mejidieh ~
