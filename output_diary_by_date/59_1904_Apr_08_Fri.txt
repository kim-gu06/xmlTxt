Light S. Ely & fine weather
But at 1 Pm it became cloudy
with thunder & lightning &
passed away without
raining here ~
The river has fallen about
an other foot, & the canal
is draining out it is now
below my wall, & formed
a mud bank as before,
Alexander went to Town
on his Bicycle at 7 1/2 am;
Rezooki Andria came out to see
the masons finishing the hot
Bath; A Crack all along the
wall separating his house
from that of Ali Bey appeared
the day before of about 1 Inch
but it is now
to be the building of Ali
Beg that have way & his
construction being some
what frail & hasty and
the late innudattion
caused the building to
part from that of Sister
Medoola from the top of
the house right down to the
ground ~
A shift of wind to S. West
began to blow furiously at
10 am with dust ~ Wind
then shifted to N.W. & fell
down & dust cleared off;
Ellen daughter of Antone
Marine called on us ~
Alexander came out at
5 P.m. from town ~
I took for dinner soup, Cutlet
& some stew with potatoes &
I felt well, with little wind &
turned in at 10 ~
