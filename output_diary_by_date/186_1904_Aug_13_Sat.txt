Very fresh wind from
N.W. & cloudy all over,
wind blowing with violence
My throat is the same

that pricking like a needle,
Sister medoola & her
husband Rezooki came

With 590 bricks etc

The day has been warm but sultry
with clouds ~
A dead body from Cholera
of a mason died in Baghdad
passed my house to the burial
of Seyd Dreez in the Kerrada;
Light westward & fine
new moon two days old;
