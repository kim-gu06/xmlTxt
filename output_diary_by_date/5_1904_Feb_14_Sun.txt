Thu6. 48
At 1 1/2 AM I awoke and
soon after I begun to feel so
weak & giddy & fainting
from weakness I became
cold & unable to move my
hand I sung out to my
wife to come to me, & I
could not lift my head
1904
Feby
the noise & wind working
in my stomach & intestines
was awful, & my bowels
worked under me without
my consciousnes, Alexander
came also to me & they
gave me Brandy & water
but I was too weak my eyes
could not be opened and
then I felt inclined to vomit
and so I did a good quantity
of dark red & I examined
it & found it must be blood
with it & coagulated pieces
of Albumen which frightened
me & made me worse
I felt better afterward and
had a good rest, but unable
to move up my head ~
The SS. Mejidieh arrived
at Gherrara yesterday evening
& the Comet was sent down
& brought the mail up
at 11 P.M. last night ~
I sent Alexander to
fetch Nizam ed Din. He
came at 10 AM. examined
the vomiting & could not
tell me exactly what it is, once
he said from forcing myself to
vomit, but I never did so,
then he said it is probably
from the effect of medicines
but it is not blood. He prescribed
nothing but only to have
a rest today, & not to take
much liquid stuff as
milk or soda, so as not to
cause vomiting, but only
the jelly & continue to Bismuto
Magnesium ~
Great many people called
on us today from morning
till sunset, all my sisters
& their children (except sister
Eliza who is still in bed with
diarrhea & weakness)
At 4 P.M. Again the wind
came on & worked up & the pain
increased & made me very
restless & prevented me from
sleeping, Alexander came
to sleep with us in the Oursy
I dosed off to sleep & awoke
at 11 with the pain rather
severe, so I took a dose
1904
Feby
of the Morphine Cocain and
little while after it checked
the pain & I felt well &
slept, taking little Champagn
& Brandy & Water & little
Jelly ~
