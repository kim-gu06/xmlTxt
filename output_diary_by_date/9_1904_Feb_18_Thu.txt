A very sensational affair
happened early this morning
at the British Residency,
A Sepoy being the nephew
of the murdered Subadar
officer who had also participated
with the Other Sepoys in the
murder & was imprisoned
& then liberated by Major
New March & returned to
duty, while on guard, he
shot dead with his Mausar
Rifle,
three
two Sepoys and
two Indian Cavasses, while
they were asleep in the Residency
and then went out to the
stable where the Other Sepoys
were & shot an Other one.
making in all five, Major
New March, who heard
the report, ran out & went
to the top of the house and
through a passage bridge
over the road went to
Lynchsâ€™ Khan overlooking
the stable, and ordered the
Sepoy to throw his rifle, the
latter did and said to the
Major that he would have
shot him too, but he has
no more cartridges, he
was ceased & chained
and an awful confusion
