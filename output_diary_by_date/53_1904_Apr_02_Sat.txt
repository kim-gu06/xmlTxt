The river felt about 6 feet,
At 8 am Alexander & I
called on Sister Emilia, she
is as mad as ever, & even worse
At 10 ½ I left and called on Sister Medoola
At 2 P.M. Alexander & I
taking the Coolie form went to
Kardurrarri in the Tramway,
started at 2 ½ P.M. and alighted
at the Kasr of Agha Mahoned
where Agha Ibrahim his
brother was, he was very polite
and obliging; Alexander left
me there & walked to Kardurrarri
to see some of his friends,
I spoke with Agha Ibrahim
about my money & the sale of
the property, etc, & showed him
a paper which I drew up for
him to sign; it is only a
promissory agreement, that
if he does not pay my 900 Lira
after the expiration on the 4
of May, that he will have to
pay me the interest as long
as it is remains due, he is
quite agreeable and asked me
only to let him consul & the
inheritors, (the mother & wives
of the late Agha Mahomed);
I encouraged him to speak to
Seyd Hassan Bassam the
agent of sey & Ali Yewayed
for restitution of my money
the 350 Liras & I am in great
want of it, he also promised
to do it; he offered coffee & Tea
& at 4 P.M. I left & walked
to Kardurrarri to meet Alexander
he sent his servant with me
instructing him to pay also
for our Tram tickets @ 4 R.O.
each; I met Alexander in
the Tram cart on the point
of starting, so I had
