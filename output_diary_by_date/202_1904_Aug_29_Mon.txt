Th5. 78
Modte northernly breeze
and fine
At 5 1/2 AM the S.S. Phrat
passed down ~
At 6 I walked in to town
with my boy Hamna and
reached at 6 3/4 ~ our
watchman Abdulrahmin
asked me to allow him
to go to the mosque
of Adlyeh where he wants
to stay 40 days to make
his penitence as seclusion
he being very religious
& is bringing and other in
his place, so I had to
Allow him & he brought
an other Indian by name
Fookhood Din, but not
so good as him ~
I hear that my wife is
going to Basreh tomorrow
in the Mejidieh, with the
four children of Angoorly
& Medoola Stifan Gorgi
& our former cook
Elyeh, & two female servants,
So I had to get the
Jew Dellals to take her
Takhir ar deposition for
the sale of my little house
(which is in her name)
and as the little Deeds are
not finished yet in the
1904
Augst
Tapo Alexander who also
rode in after me, but
to inform his mother
an Agent should be
appointed by us to give
the Takrir & that Artin
my nephew is appointed,
so the Dellals & Elias
the clerk of Alexander
took people from the
Mahkemeh as well as
the mokhtar Mahomed
el Sobbagh & went to
my wife but they wanted
Artin also to come,
So I sent for him and
it was all done by
noon; I had to pay
all the fees & expenses
of the Mahkemeh and
to the mokhtars & stamps
which has amounted
to about 40 Beshlics,
all this loss is through
my wife's leaving to Basreh,
I called on Menusha
to see whether they are
all going down with me,
but she said she will not
be ready before tomorrow
or the day after; ~
A Christian the brother
in law of Georgi's the Tallyman
of Lynch, died from Cholera
yesterday, he was attacked
the day before, at the
Flour Mill outside the
Babel Moaddem, the
sickness is the same among
the Mahomedans & Jews,
perhaps slightly decreased
At 4 P.M. I called on
Sister Emilia & then on
Eliza, where Alexander
came in a Goffa & Kit
& at 5 1/4 we came down
to my new house ~
Very light N.W. breeze and
warm weather ~
It became cooler later
on at night ~
