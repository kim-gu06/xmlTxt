Th6. 58
Light S. Ely breeze and
Cloudy all over overcast weath,
I slept well lastnight &
had no pain, as I ate very
little (a piece of cutlet & one
Potato.)
The river fell about 1 foot,
the water in the gardens
is soaked in the soil,
my stair Arch is cracked on
account of the flooding
in Sister medoolaâ€™s garden
court ~
It rained slightly
For a short time at 8 am;
I took only some cultets
& boiled pumpkins & two
spoons of Pilam at breakfast
& a little arrowroot & jam,
I am not so much puffed
up as yesterday, I am
not taking the Bismuth
Magnesieum of Pepsine;
At 3 1/2 P.M. Alexander
Came down in a goffa;
Rezooki Andria also
came this morning, we
took tea here & at 5 P.m
they left to go to town, Rezooki
on a donkey & alexander
on his Bicycle; ~
weather clearing up
& getting fine ~
We spoke to mahomed
al Jassim to let Louisa &
by mosh and yousif yaghchi
enough on his ground
facing my house; &
settled it for 1 T. Lira
all the time ~
I took dinner some fried cutlets
& boiled pumpkins, but I felt so
heavy & puffed up with wind
I could not sleep, the nausea
1904
April
and wind coming up used to
awake one, & I had indigestion
I got that I feel always inclined
to vomit; ~
