Satur
The 4-80
Noon 106
Very light N.W. breeze &
fine weather ~
At 6 Â½ AM. I rode in to town
& sent my boy Hanna forward
I got home at 7, The Indian
watchman Abdulrahim
is guarding the house well;
I cleaned our sleeping room
from so much dirt & rubish
also the Bath room
It is much hotter in the house
in town than in my house
outside where there is always
some breeze coming across
the river ~
I took a bath with
cold water or rather
bodywarm
lukewarm
I called on Menusha at 6 P.M.
but she was not at home,
I dined & slept on top of the house
nice & cool night ~
