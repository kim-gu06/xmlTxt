Light N.W. & fine clear
and Cool Weather; my bowels
worked early very loose with much
wind & noise; although I had
taken last night a dose of
the quassine which Dr. Nezam
ed Din had prescribed for the
wind & full stomach, it did
no good; I feel so weak and
unwell; ~
At 7 1/4 am. I went to the
Latin Church for the Celebration
of a mass & Requiem for the
40th day of poor Alice's death,
Alexander & Marie also came
to town on donkey, & came
to Church at 8 1/2, we then
all left & went to Sister
Emilia, she was very grieved
& weeped much, all the
relatives were there,
At 11 I came home to prepare
to go down in the goffa to my
new house ~
The river is rising, it rose
about 3 bricks this morning,
Alexander marie & I breakfasted
at home, I took only some
cutlets & potatoes; but I think
it is the bread that I eat much
of it is causing this puffing
up of my stomach & I must
abstain ~
Metty Yacoob called on
me, also Jem is son of Yacoob
Tessy, I gave them my letters
for Rezooki & Rufail Sayegh,
At 2 1/2 P.m. Alexander
marie & I taking the boy Hanna
with us & came down in
the goffa to my new house
in 25 minutes, found my
wife alright here with the
servants Zekki, & Habooba
& little Cecil ~
I planted the two young
Berhi date trees & the
plantains which R. Sayegh
sent me in the Mejideih,
Yacoob Eassayi & his
wife called on us ~
