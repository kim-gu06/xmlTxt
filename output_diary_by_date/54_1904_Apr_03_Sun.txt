Sunday Easter ~
At 2 AM it began to rain,
drizzly, for about one hour
it cleared up in the morning,
my bowels worked very
loose, twice & I do not feel
well, yet ~
At 8 AM I went to Church
called on Menusha & came
home ~
the river has risin
about 4 feet & current very
strong & is still rising fast,
I prepared my Kit etc to
go down to my new house,
took breakfast, a little
rice soup, and a piece of roast
fowel etc;
At 9 ¼ AM I went down
in a Goffo with my boy Hanna,
The SS. Khalifah passed
up at 9 ½ just as I shoved
off, she is going very slow
the current very strong &
the river rose another 2 feet,
nearly attaining its
normal high rise, I reached
my house in ½ hour; I
found the river had risen so
much & damaged my Luold
of thorn nearly sunk down,
also the camal of Bahrain
Begs Garden, is overflowed
and the sand bank along
the wall of my house getting
eaten away & melting &
the water is running on
the wall, but as it is built
very strongly I need not
be afraid of doing any
damage, the river keeps
rising & current very
strong; ~
