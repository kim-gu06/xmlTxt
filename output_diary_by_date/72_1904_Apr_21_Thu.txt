Th6. 59
Light n. w. & fine Clear
mild weather ~
I felt so very weak from
the vomiting; I took a Cup
of milk & the 2 eggs; but not
with pleasure ~
Alexander went into town
at 7 ½ am, I told him to see
Dr. Brigstocke if he can see
me tomorrow, I will go in
to town ~
At breakfast I took a little
rice soup & a small piece
of cutlet to as not to load
my stomach & had to remain
very hungry still ~
Alexander came out at 5 P. m.
he has informed Dr. Brigstocke
of my visiting him & he
appointed the time for
tomorrow so I must go in,
I see even if I do not load
my stomach with much
food, still I have the wind
& derangement but in a
small quantity, I feel
so very thirsty now;
I am always inclined to drink
water~ But the weakness
that I feel is awful, I cannot
walk, my Knee’s are trembling
& always inclined to lay
down ~
In the evening Antone
marine, his son gabriel,
Yousif Asfar & Albertson
of jeboory Asfar called
on us ~
I took nothing for dinner but
very little arrowroot & milk, &
was not well, the wind still

Troubling me all the night,
with noise in the intestines;
