Light N.W. & fine cool
morning, I could not sleep
well last night from my
cold & cough, & also sandflies,
Rufail never answered
my letter of Saturday &
not even come to see me
for the last five days,
But at 7 Â½ he came to me
as he was going to ride in
to town & asked me where I
wish to have the 20 Liras
paid I told him to Alexander
as I owe him about 30 Liras,
So with this 20 Liras & 20
he had paid me about
20 days ago, make 40,
which is the interest on
my 1000 Liras lent to him
for 6 months only he wants
to keep it; it will fall
due on the 6 of Rabi el
Thani or 18 of this month
of June. ~
Only one Tilkefli came today
to paint, the other Khammo
is unwell; ~
The SS. Ressafah passed
down yesterday morning
having troops on board;
Very light air & fine weather
I am still sleeping in the room
on account of my bad cold
