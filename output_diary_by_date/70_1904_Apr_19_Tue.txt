Fresh N. W. Wind & cold,
with clouds; I feel better &
no indigestion or heartburn,
We sent Hanna the boy to
town to buy us provision,
The SS. Phrat passed
down at 7 Â½ Am ~
I took only a Cup of milk
& an egg, & feel better, my
bowels worked costive;
For breakfast I took very little potato
hashed with milk, & some arrowroot
& I begun to feel the wind coming
on but slightly, so remained
feeling very hungry &
to eat, I feel quite different
than what I used to feel before,
my mouth has no taste, &
the stomach cannot stand
or support anything that
goes into it, it causes wind
in the intestine; I took
often a little milk & soda

Fresh N.W. wind blowing
during the day & little cloudy,
In the evening I felt very weak
so I took a little cognac & soda
water; I took a little potato mixed
with milk & a little meat & arrowroot
& left my stomach light, I felt
better & had no nausea or heartburn
at night ~
