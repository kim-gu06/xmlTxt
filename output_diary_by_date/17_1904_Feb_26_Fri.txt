Ely breeze & fine weather.
I feel stronger, & my bowels
worked mild & the
wind is passing away;
Sister Emilia called to see
me ~ the pain of the wind
came again troubling me
much, I took this morning
a cup of the bitter mixture of
Nux Vomica, Bella Donna
& Cascara, but it does not
agree with me, it stirrs my
appetite & taste in mouth,
The receipt of this tonic is
Cascara Sograda 10. grammes
Leint’de Nux Vomica 2..50 &
Can de Menth _ 3 tas a cafe’
Leinth de Belladonna 30 gouttes,
I got 10 Plants from Moadem
where I sent Juma the Coolie
to get me 4 Portugal, 2 Naringhi,
2 Purnloin & 2 Lurrisej for 158 P
. in all, & Alexander took
them in the Goffa down to
my new house to plant
them this afternoon ~
I took rice soup only for my
breakfast & little Arrowroot,
the wind still troubling me So
I took cold milk & Lime water,
which is doing good & the wind
& pain passing away, my bowels
also worked mild at 4 P.M.
I took for dinner at 7 P.M. the
rice soup with very little boiled
chicken & this did me great
harm, it did not digest and
the stomach being weak yet
could not support it, I got the
indigestion, nausea & all the
night inclined to vomit with
lots of wind, & so I suffered
the whole night, ~
