At 1 AM my bowels worked
very loose & Costive mixed
& lots of Wind passed down
which made me feel
easyier & better,
Weather bad, a strong
S. Ely Wind blowing and
Clouds scattered, it is a
thretening Weather;
My Wife rode into town
at 8 A.M. I sent Muttar
the Arab with her; I wrote
a letter to Rezooki Sayegh
& sent it to Alexander to be
sent down by Khalifah;
Carpenters & Masons come
to work;
A strong squal got up at 9
A.M. with very thick dust, that
one cannot see within 20
yards & became cloudy
all over & gloomy ~
At 5 P.M. Alexander Came
to me on his Bicycle to spend
the night;
Wind fell down & is
Clearing up; but it is S.East,
I felt very unwell all the
day & in the evening got worse,
the wind puffed me up & pain
& indigestion, perhaps from
eating little fowell at
breakfast & then some
1904
Mch
Plum jam etc ~ Alexander
took his dinner alone; I
could not sleep from the wind
& indigestion until midnight,
