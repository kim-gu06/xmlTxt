Antone Marine & his son
Gabriel came out on horse
back to see the garden of
Farhat where they intend
to encamp, they came to
see me; ~ Yousif Eassayi
& Rafooli Tanton called to

I got upset in my stomach
it again got puffed up with
wind & pain from the
heavy breakfast I ate
too much fish, I cannot
breath, so ful of wind
& nausia; ~ I could not
touch any food at all and
had to lay down in bed at
6 P.M. & always inclined to vomit
with a cholic pain till 8 P.M.
when I vomited my breakfast
& was still restless with pain
& wind until 9 when I again
vomited all the rest of my
food of soup & fish and
then I felt quiet & slept well
till 12 I awoke & took a
cup of cold milk & soda
water & slept easy till day
break; I had abused myself
in eating too much fish &
the stomach could not
support it ~
