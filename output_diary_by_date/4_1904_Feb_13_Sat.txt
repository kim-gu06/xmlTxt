At 2 am. I took some Jelly
& some cornflower & slept
better, the pain had gone,
Light N.W. & fine weather
I took a dose of Bismuto Magnesium
I sent a telegram today
to Rezooki Sayegh Basreh,
asking him to send me
up two fine vines of the
black grapes by Mejidieh
for my house outside,
At 1 P.M. Alexander Marie
& the little Cecil went in on
carriage out to my new
house to spend the day
taking with them Sister
Medoola, my nieces Alice
& Harriette, I sent with Alexander
some slips of flower plants
as Jassmine, Rose, Dijleh from
Artin to plant them ~
I hear that news came
yesterday that war has
been declared today between
Russia & Japan, on account
of Russia's encroachment
on Manchuria & Corea,
I have very slight pain
of wind in stomach,
I am taking some jelly,
& milk & a little corn flower
but my mouth is very
tastless & am very
weak, I am walking out
a little but cannot stand
long, I shoved a piece of
soap up the anus, but nothing
came out except a little
blood from strening ~
At 4 P.M. the wind came on
& working up to my stomach
begun to pain me & kept so
increasing, I begun to use
very hot poultesses of Linseed
but did no good, I took
then a few spoons of rice soup
still it kept increasing
At 9 I took a dose of the morphine
& cocain after an hour
it soothed the pain & I slept
I awoke at 11 & felt myself
very well & refreshed & I slept again ~
