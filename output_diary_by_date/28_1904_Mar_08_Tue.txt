Tuesd
Th.6.53
S. Ely breeze & hazy
weather ~ At 3 1/2 A.M. I
had to go to the stool and
bowels worked loose with
much wind I feel relieved
We took milk & coffee with
Alexander & at 7 1/2 A.M. he
returned to town ~
Masons came to work
and one carpenter Selman
to make me two doors one
for the terrace where the
ladder is put up, & the other
for the W. Closet of the terrace
I sent our Watchman to Baghdad
for some Kit, he came back
with a letter from Alexander
sending me an Other bottle
of Champagne, this is
the sixth bottle that he
has been giving me,
Alexander says that the
rumour in town is that
four Cases of Cholera
have taken place in
Baghdad;
I took only the rice
soup for breakfast, and
a piece of toasted bread
I felt alright all through
the day, & now not so puffed
up; I took at 5 1/2 P.M. half
a Cup of hot milk & coffee with
a small piece of burnt bread
& two or three spoonfuls of
Arrowroot, & I feel much
easier & lighter. ~ I had
taken this morning a little
Pepsine powder with my
milk & coffee; I took twice
the Bismutho magnesienne,
I felt very well at night and
slept well; I took twice some
arrowroot & an orange at
night ~
