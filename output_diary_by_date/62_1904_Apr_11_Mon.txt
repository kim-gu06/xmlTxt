yesterday ~
At 10 1/2 am. the SS. Mejidieh
arrived; I received letters from
Ruphail & Rezooki, the latter has
sent me a few Plants of Plantain
& two young date trees which
I had asked him to plant in
any new house outside ~
At 12 Alexander & I went
over to Sister Medoola and
breakfasted there by invitation
& at 1 P.M. I came home, I
ate a cutlet & potatoes & a piece
of roast fowel a little pilaw
& some cornflour with milk,
it did not do me harm, but
a little wind in the bowels ~

I do not feel well, still the wind
and trouble in stomach, and
I only took a little Cutlet and
potatoes for dinner & some arrow-
root, but I suffered at night from
indigestion & wind & acidity &
heartburn the whole night,
