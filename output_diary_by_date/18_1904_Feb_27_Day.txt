Modte N.W. & fine weather
I suffered awfully during the
night always inclined to
vomit the rice soup, with
much wind & pain, a cramp
in stomach, I took a cup
of the bitter mixture & at 9 AM
a cup of milk with coffee,
my bowels worked very loose
like water & pain & wind
still troubling me ~

Today being the Holy day
of Moharrem among the

I took nothing today having
no appetite at all, except
at 3 Â½ P.M. I took few spoons
of rice pudding & little
milk with Lime Water, &
I feel quiete; ~ At 6 my bowels
worked a little very loose, and
I feel it does me good ~
