Light Ely breeze, with
some clouds, & not refreshing
I am painting the doors
& balcony myself the whole
day; I sent my watchman
1904
May
Jassim to town with a letter
to Alexander & got me some
provision & print as apples,
apricots, & goujeh, I am
breakfasting in the Serdale
since yesterday, it is too
hot to stay upstairs, but
there is a light Ely Wind
& it shifted to N.W. ~
I called on Sister Medoola
at 4 P.M. & then on Rufail
at 6 & came home,
Weather cloudy all over,
light N.W. but not refreshing
it is so sultry & disagreeable,
but it is cooler on the
Terrace ~
