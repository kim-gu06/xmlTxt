Père Pièrre called on
us at 6 ½ AM on his way
down to the Father’s Garden
at Nmel Adam, he spoke
to me about my wife’s
demanding her Kit,
I consented most willingly
to acquiesce to her demand
& I asked him to be present
also himself, but he declined
& we thought of asking
Yacob Oossy Messiyen
& Risha Maghak Kasperkhan
to be present & she can
claim what actually
belongs to her ~
Alexander went into town
at 7 ½ AM ~
Nassoory son of Loma
Khayat (Brother of the
Chaldean Priest Theodore)
1904
June
died yesterday afternoon
from a long suffering of
dysentery, & hemorrhoids
he was over 65 years old
he came from Basreh
lately with this malady
he had for years, he
leaves a large family
his wife is the daughter
of Eassayi, his eldest
son is Dr. Behjet & has
three other sons employed
at Basreh ~
The day has not been so hot,
the N.W. Wind blowing until
6 P.M. when it fell.~
Sister Medoola called on
us;
I do not feel well since
two days, this ungrateful
behavior of my wife &
the scandalous way she
is causing among the
people is very unbecoming
for a person like her and
for our name and reputation
Her infatuity and bad
temper, and also her arrogance
in the way she speaks &
threatens us, have become
so intolerable, it is very
curious that whenever
she sees one of her sons
or daughters come up from
Basreh, she gets so unmanageable
and does not care a
bit for us or for the
management of the house
as she did two years
ago, when Tookyeh had
come up & she also cast
us up & went to live with
her & went to Basreh
with her~ All this and
other misbehavior have
cased me much grief
& pain to see my wife
treating me in this
manner ~
Alexander came out riding
at 6 ½ P.M; his mother did
not come to the house,
he thinks Rufail will get
