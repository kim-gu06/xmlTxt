Alexander went in to town
riding at 7 am; also Harriette
my niece left sister medoola’s

The SS. Ressafah left yesterday
morning ~
I sent for Rkheteh the
widow & Haji Ali, the owner
of the other half of the garden
of Bahram Beg to speak
to her for the sale of the
piece of ground on the
river which we wanted
to buy from her last year
& she wanted only to give
28 Draaz by 35; as Rufail
should like to buy it
so Rezooki andria & I
spoke to her to sell the
piece but it should be
30 draaz facing the river
& 40 draaz in land, and
offered her 300 Liras, but
she declined, she wants 400,
& so left it for her to Consider,
as she had asked me
before to find a buyer
for this piece; ~
At 11 ½ Alexander came back
from town ~
Light n.w. & fine pleasant
