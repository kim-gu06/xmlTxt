Th5. 80
Light S. Ely breeze &
Cloudy Weather Sultry,
My wife went to town this
morning with Medoola
Stephan Jorge, to clean the
Serdab & other work in
Rufails house, they went
up in a Goffa ~
I called on Rufail with
Alexander at 8 AM, the
widow of Shekoory Sayegh
wishes to appoint Rufail
from her part to our name
the accounts with Alexander,
The day was warm with a
light variable air ~
In the evening I took my
bed up on top of the terrace
& also our dinner table
& arranged every thing to
shift up & sleep, only
Alexander & Masie could
not go up as Cecil has
still sore eyes; a very
light air shifting from
one side to the other,
My wife came down in
a Goffa with the servant
of Rufail & Medoola Stifan
Gorgi & landed at Rufailâ€™s
Tents; very warm &
sultry close weather,
some clouds are still
hanging about; It is
very nice & pleasant

on top of the house;
Cecil was not quiet tonight
she could not sleep from her
sore eyes; Alexander came up
& slept on top of the house,
Weather calm & a very light
Ely breeze ~
