The S.S. Mejidieh left at 5
A.M. ~
I feel well & slept well, but
my bowels worked loose at 3 AM
& this morning too; I took
my milk & Coffee & eggs with
little butter & Jam, but felt
it rather heavy & caused wind
in the intestines ~
Alexander came in at 8 AM.
We then went to Rufail, they
are sending Kit down in a
Goffa, I gave Rufail an
Other Bicholea Tent; we
went to the Indian Abdulali’s
shop & bought some provision
My Wife sent me some Stew
with meat; took some Leben
also arrowroot & Jam for
breakfast ~
At 2 P.M., I took Rufail
with me in the Goffa with
my Kit & some of his & my
boy Hanna & came down
to my new house, where all
Rufail’s Kit is being
landed. We then looked
for a place & found the
best encamping ground
is the one of Mahomed el
Jassim just facing my
house Northward,
Antone Marine also came,
We then Called Mahomed
to my house & I settled it
with him by paying him
Six Mejidies per month
for the three Tents etc,
his ground is just planted
with Badmjan & Tomato,
he has to pick them all
out; & we got Arabs to
make the ground even
It is the best place out here,
there is a very nice & cool
place under the Mulberry
