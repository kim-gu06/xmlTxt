Modte N.W. wind and
freshening up;
At 6 ¾ AM Alexander &
I rode in to town and came home,
my boy Hanna also ~
I sent for Yacoob Oossy but
he was not at home, so I
sent Alexander to Père Pièrre
to see what he has done
yesterday; he told him that
he spoke to Yacoob Oossy
& Risha Khaghak & they
are ready to come at 8 ½
AM; I went to Yacoob
Oosy’s house and found
him just returning so
I took him home & then
explain all to him
and what my wife wishes
to take away, her Kit by
proving & on oath that
it belongs to her and
she has bought them
with her own money
Reesha Maghak also
came & I explained to
him & we sent for my
wife, she came and knocked
at the door in such a
furious way, & scolded
my Indian watchman & a
bused him for
not having let her
come in three days ago,
she was so fearfully
enraged & in such a
language that I never
seen her doing so before
she pitched into Alexander
& called him every thing
she was in fact wild
& insolent, she went into my
room & began searching for
her Kit & close, I called her
out to sit down & to speak
to the two witnesses present
that is Yacoob Oossy and
1904
June
Risha Maghak, I then
explained to them all that
since she wishes to take
away all what belongs to
her she can do so, only
the Alyiets which I doubt
if they are hers, she will have
to prove and on oath,
she consulted, I took
them to our sitting room
first, where there are two
Blackwood Satin Spring
couches she had bought
for my son to furnish his
room & given to him as
present, she claimed them
and said she will certainly
take them & not give any
thing to her son; they were
carried away by Coolies
& servants of Rufail; she
then took away a glass
candlestick with sheet
& crystal hanging she
swore that it is hers &
had bought it from Rezooki
Toni Lessy; & that was
all she had, she tried
to take her enlarged photo
framed & hanged on the
wall I declined giving
it, it was sent to Paris
& enlarged by Alexander,
but she disputed, so I
threw it on the ground
& smashed it to pieces,
we then went in the
Oorsy, she found one empty
blackood box, she took &
some worthless objects
& her sewing machine
I locked that room then,
& went in the Kefesh Koin
she took everything away
as clothes, bottles of
Arack, Rose Water, Tbacco
for Narghile, small
Bahrein mats, washing
Jugs & Basins and
1904
June
other objects, which she
made me wild to see
her mean way and
greediness in depriving
me of everything, I
could see plain that she
wants to injure me as
much as she can out
of spite, she wanted to take the bedding and
pillows but I objected
most energetically and
resisted in not letting her
take them, she saw
from me that I was willing
to allow her to take away
things that she wanted &
she took advantage of
this; Had I not been
advised by Père Pièrre &
other members of my family
to allow her to take what
she wants I would not
let her do what she liked,
but to avoid the scandals
before these two persons
& before the servants and
coolies I kept my temper
but some times she
used to pass the limits &
she was in fact, robbing
me like a depredation
& plunder, by tearing
away every thing she
can lay hold off; even
my old clothes arriving
her kit she took away
in bundles. Even my t
wo cotton blankets she
would take them away
but I took them, all sorts
of small articles, cloth,
boxes, she swept her chest
& wardrobes, & the Doolabs
in the wall, so far she
went, that at times I used
to burst out with rage
& prevent her from
1904
June
such a plunder, I kept
quiet all for the sake
of my health & the scandal
so that people on hearing
of what took place not
to blame me; and
especially that Pere Pièrre
asked me not to say
any thing; & let her take
what she likes, she even
clamed my big wardrobe
saying that I had bought
it from her late son Michail
& a few days before his
death & never paid him
the cost, well this wardrobe
I had bought it with other
furniture belonging to
Colonel Mockler a year
before Michails death
& paid for it; she took
away a lot of crockery
about 15 large flat dishes
pretending all are hers
but not half belongs to
her only about 6 or 8
old fashioned round
dishes, she took four
dozen plates dinner and
desert with flowers and
gilted round I had bought
from Asfar Khan
& she claimed them as hers
& had the courage to
swear that they were
hers, she wanted to take
my 6 gilt tumblers, but
I go so enraged that I
threw them & smashed
them all; she stole
from my other cupboard
a long linnen table
cloth & a dozen napkins
just 10 minutes before
& concealed them in her
Box with the other kit
and when I came to
1904
June
look for them I could
not find them & I asked
her then she said that
they belonged to her,
I told that I had bought
them from Angoorly at
Basreh & insisted in having
them she then took them
out of the box & gave them
up; in fact she was
trying to rob me as much
as she could; the copperware
pots, basins, two mankals
trays, washing basins
& all copper utensils she
took by saying & swearing that
she had made them
with her own money
I retained by force one
copper pot, belonging to
Alexander which, he
had brought with him
from Aleppo; & I have
four my own also brought
there from Diarbekir
& Aleppo which are out in
my new house using them
she took away what
flour, rice & ghee there
was saying that she
had bought that for
Rufail’s marriage,
she took some old carpets
& besaats from the Serdab
& finished this bloody
comedy before the coolies
servants & Yacoob Oossy
(Risha had gone at 1 P.M)
which lasted till 2 ½ P.M.
& we had not taken breakfast,
& she left the house in
a very tyred & done up
state for having done
a very good days haul
& left by saying to me
goodbye & with many
1904
June
things, I was glad to
have finished with long
standing disputes &
had prevented me from
getting any rest & piace,
we then Alexander & I,
took our breakfast,
in
but in what a state of
excitement & disgust I
was as well as Alexander
and she did not let me
quiet, but kept sending
the servant after such
& such article not taken,
she sent for her single
Iron bedstead from the
terrace which I loosend
& sent to her; she only
posseses one & it is out
in my new house, but
swore that she had this
for the last 20 years
What a scandal
she has caused in the
town among all the Christian
she has no shame, &
the fools of her brother Antone
& her son Rufail not
speaking to her & reproaching
her for such deeds which
are unbecoming to a
person like her and
at her age nearly 65
years to do such acts;
At 5 P.M. I called on my
sister Eliza & related to them
what took place they were
so astonished; Alexander
came there at 5 ½ and
then went down in a goffa
to our house; I came
home at 6; I had to
make my bed in the veranda
down below & sleep on
one of my new takhets,
it was nice & cool at
night ~
