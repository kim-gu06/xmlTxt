Modt. S. Ely wind
and fine weather,
The SS. Khalifah left
this morning ~
Weather became very cloudy &
dusty overcast ~
My bowels worked by putting a
piece of soap & came out natural
& mild ~ I took the rice soup
& a little boiled meat for breakfast,
but I feel still very weak
although I can walk out to
my room & feel always hungry,
I took for dinner the rice
soup & very small piece of
boiled meat, I took a
little Arak & water but
caused much wind and
pain, but passed away
afterward ~
S. Ely breeze & fine
night, moon of Zelhejjeh
9 days old ~
The Arak & then the rice
soup & little meat caused me
much wind pain & noise
all the night ~ At midnight
I took little milk & jelly
still the pain did not go.
The wind had caused
with noise & pricking;
