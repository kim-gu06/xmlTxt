very critical state and
that my presence to come in
to town would be much
required, I hastened immediately
& left the two servants Zekki
& Hanna to look after the
house, & I had much difficulty
in riding, I dismounted at
Alices’ house, when I
heard that poor & beloved
Alice had expired exactly
at noon, all our relatives
were there, also my Wife,
Alexander & Marie, what
an awful state my Sister
Emilia is in, she is mad
for she used to adore her
only daughter and she alone
was her comfort & happiness,
What a blow for poor Emilia
Alice’s sickness was a severe
attack of typhoid fever
since the 1st Instant. The
day previous she had played
the Tennis at the Residency
garden & there cought a
Chill, she complained of
headache & Cold; Dr
Cor of the Residency, Dr.
Brigstocke of the English
Missionary society & Dr
Nizam ed Din where attending
her illness, which got complicated
and turned into Menengitis,
or Cerebral fever & an
inflammation of the membrane,
She was put on a strict diet
of nothing but Milk & Soda
being so delicate & weak
I went to see her body in
bed & prayed & then Kissed
her, the Nuns (sisters of
Mercy) are attending her,
Oh poor Alice she left her
fine house & furniture So
exposed, what a Cruel
death, at such a premature
age & how quick she disappeared
from among us, Every
body is sorry & lamenting
her loss; She Was born
on the 29th of Septr 1861,
When I was employed
at her father Richard Rogers
as a Clerk & Dragoman at
Maghil near Basreh when
he was English Vice Consul
for three years ~ We

European & natives to invite
them for tomorrow to
accompany the funeral to
the Latin Church at 8 AM.;

tyred from the ride & the long
walk to my house which I
have not done yet since I
took ill on the 8 of Janny;
I took some milk & arrowroot
& feel better, my bowels are
working regular, also at
night I took some milk etc
and slept well, but interrupted
from the thought & grief of
poor Alice’s loss it seems
to me so incredible in such
a short time, she was carried
away; the last time I saw
her, when she came to see
me, I was in bed;
