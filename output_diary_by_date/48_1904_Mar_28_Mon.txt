Light N.W. & fine
cold weather, at 4 AM.
I had to go to the stool and
bowels worked loose, but
I feel weak
I took my milk & coffee
& two eggs;
Sent my servant
boy Hanna to Baghdad
& at 7 ½ AM I rode in as
I have business to go with
Menusha to Major Newmarch
the Consul, to take 100 Liras
for mortgage she has got
of a house for one offar,
I got home at 8, got Hanna
to make me breakfast ~
Menusha called on me to
ask when we are to go to Major
Newmarch to get the 100 Liras,
I went out to the bazaar & then
called on M. Rozenfeld, he
said that he is going also &
we can go now;
I met Eliahoo Dennoos he advised
me to report Agha Ibrahim
the nomad who Owes me the
money to Major Newmarch
& to write to the former that
if he does not guarantee his
brother’s debt of 900 Ł that I
shall report him to Major
Newmarch ~ I then went to
take Menusha & we went to
the British Consulate, where
Rosenfeld also was, we received
the 100 Ł & signed two receipts,
I spoke to Major Newmarch
regarding my claim and
the mortgage of the garden
by Agha Ibrahim & the late
brother of Agha Ibrahim,
He told me that he cannot
interfere in the matter, since
it is a mortgage of property
and has to be settled with the
Turkish Authority (but he
is mistaken I have no complaint
against the property, I only
wants him to speak to Agla
Ibrahim to persuade him
to guarantee my claim, the
same as his brother did
since he is now the adminis-
trator) and besides I must
wait until he sells the property,
so we left and I came home,
At 1 P.M. I went to see Dr.
Nizam ad Din and told him about
my state of my stomach &
the wind always after I
eat anything & of what I
had yesterday, he advised
me not to eat things which
injure my stomach and presented
me 10 wafers of quassine
to take one whenever
I feel so much wind
puffing in stomach,
I called to see sister Medoola
but she was not at home,
I have again the wind and
cholic in stomach like
yesterday ~
At 4 P.M. I went to father
Philippus and confessed, I have
not done it since the year
before last; I came home &
laid up, I could take no Soup
or anything else, I felt very
bad wind and pain and cold
shiver, I took the quassine
medicine and turned in, it seemed
to have done me good, all
the wind abated, and I slept well,
At 11 P.M. the SS. Mejidich
arrived ~
