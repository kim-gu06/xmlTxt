Thursd
Th6.50
Light S.Ely wind and
Cloudy, ~
Again my bowels worked
very loose at 6 A.M. &
with much wind;
I took a cup of Milk & Coffee
& a warm egg in the morning,
I took some rice soup
for breakfast but it caused
great pain like a cannon
ball on my stomach &
full of wind, & the wind
coming out like idigestion
I am very uneasy and
suffering pain of wind
& not inclined to eat
anything;
I got carpenters & masons
working today putting
up the frame work of
the Balcony, & a Beytoome
up on top of the house,
At 4 ½ P.M. it became
very gloomy cloudy with
loud thunder & lightning
& a heavy rain came
down it lasted for
about 2 ½ hours
& did much good ~
I felt so full & puffed up
& could not sleep. I took
a dose of the bitter mixture
but after a while at 8 P.M.
I vomited lots of liquid
sour & felt much relieved
& better, & I slept quietly,
At 9, it again thundered
& rained for about ¼ hour
& remained Cloudy dark,
My Wife also took ill
at night & got the indigestion,
her bowels opened, and
she vomited too, ~
