Modte S. Ely wind &
weather getting cloudy all
over ~ I took my milk & 2
eggs; I feel alright ~
At 8 AM I went over to see
Rufail & the children of his
poor sister, Yousif, Roliki,
Philip and Mary, also my
wife went there;
Alexander came in & he came
also to Rufail’s. ~ We left at 9,
I feel that the milk perhaps in
the morning is causing the
wind & puffing, as I have
a little now ~
At 9 ½ I went to see sister
Emilia, she does not know
what to do, & where to go to
live and wants to sell all the
extra furniture & let the house
to somebody. I then called
on Sister Eliza; her daughter
Regina is going down this
time by the Mejidieh to go
to Bombay in B.S. Steamers
to join her husband Duncan
Alexander; I bid her
goodbye and came home at
11 ~
Cloudy S. Ely and warm
weather;
Alexander went to breakfast
at Rufail’s they sent me 5 small
pieces of kebab, but I only
ate two with some bread &
Pepsin, & a few spears of
Leben; the wind is confined
but it does not puff so much
or irritates me, I would
have got it, had I eaten more,
At 3 P.M. I called on
Mensha & at 4 went to
Rufail. Lots of visitors are
calling there ~
Alexander went out on
his bicycle at 5 ½ & I came
home ~  I have some
1904
April
wind in stomach, & it is digging
me but it is bearable;
Weather cloudy gloomy
& S. Ely ~ At 6 ½ it shifted to
West, & is clearing up the dust,
I took for dinner the few
pieces of kebab left, with Pepsin,
and then few spears of Leben,
arrowroot & jelly; I feel
nearly puffed up and full;
My wife came home at 9 P.M. I
slept well & took some Leben &
arrowroot at night and feel well,
