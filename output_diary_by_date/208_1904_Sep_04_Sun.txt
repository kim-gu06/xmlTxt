Modte N.W. & fine cool
morning;
At 10 AM Menusha
& I went to hear mass at
Asfars, but there were too
many people from 80 to 85
persons & there was no room
upstairs; I then called with
Alexander & Rezooki Audria
on Eassayi (Yousif) on
Lantons & Sister Medoola,
While out shooting
on the Gherrara road,
the four young lads Antone
my nephew who had
taken Alexander's gun,
Antone son of Johnny, &
Antone son of Jeboory
Tanton, some soldiers were
passing they seazed
their guns & took them
away because they had
no permit, & they wanted
a Mejidie from each to
give them back, we
sent people after them &
I gave my permit to
Alexander by which he
saved his gun, but the
others had to pay the
two mejidies; the Soldiers
had no right to interfere
as they do not belong
to the six contribution,
but they intimidate the
boys to extort money;
Strong wind blowing,
At 4 P.M. I went to Louisa
