Light breeze from
N.W. & fine ~ It was calm
all the night last night;
At 8 1/4 alexander came
in from outside in the carriage
At 9 3/4 the S.S. Mijidieh
arrived in freeing only the
Lines of India from Rezooki
& no letters; ~
It became very hot today,
the sun is like fire ~
at about 3 P.M my throat began
to irritate me & especially that
place where the fish bone
had stuck, I tryed by swallowing
bread & drinking, it got worse,
I shoved a quill with a piece
of cotton & smothered with
oil of almond, & irritated
1904
Augst
my throat on the left gall;
I found the pain so pressing
that I cannot possibly
go down today with alexander
without consulting the doctor,
So I went Nezam ed Din,
he examined my throat &
shoved his finger & searched
about but found nothing &
no bone; he prescribed
me a gargle to use and
I went & got it, I went
to alexander's Office,
At 5 3/4 P.M. Alexander
& I with the boy Hanna &
a lot of kit & provision & we
got to our house at 7,
I saw Marie & Cecil all well,
the pain still troubling me,
& the gargle is not making
any better;
Very light N.W.
breeze & pleasant ~
The opposite side of the
river is getting full of
Tents people are encamping
Christians & Europeans
all along the bank there
is the place to be let, as
it is all engaged; also
on our side from Kerop
Sethyan's house & upward
is getting filled with Tents
in a few days more, as
every year the Christians
do, & especially this year
on accounting of the Cholera,
at Gherrara the Jews
have gone this year;
Wind got up at night
& blew very fresh & also it
got cloudy ~
