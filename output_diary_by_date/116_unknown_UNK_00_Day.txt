Light N.W. breeze and
fine weather ~
My cold is better, I slept in the
room & found it nice & pleasant,
The two Tilkeflies Khammo
& his brother Naoomy are sleeping
here & working in painting;
I sent for my wife to open her
room so as to be painted
the windows etc on the canal.
She came & opened it and
remained, but never spoke
to me anything at all;
I called on sister Medoola
for Â½ hour ~
My cold in chest is just as bad
as before, it is very irritating
& harsh ~ I arrived & slept in
my room, & found it nice & cool,
& no sandflies or mosquitoes,
