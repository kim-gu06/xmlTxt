Feby
I took today with my rice
soup at noon a small piece
of boiled fish for the first
time since forty days & found
it most delicious & nice
At 8 P.M. it blew fresh S.E.
with dark clouds & thunder
& it rained drizzly for about
1/2 hour ~
The funeral of Kerop Effendi
Kouyoumdjian passed our
house at 3 P.M. to the Armenian
Orthodox Church where his
body was also interred;
I took for dinner the rice
soup & also some boiled
cold fish which I ate with
great appetite; At night
I took twice milk & jelly
but I was puffed up &
had much wind in
stomach but no pain,
It blew fresh S.E.wind
