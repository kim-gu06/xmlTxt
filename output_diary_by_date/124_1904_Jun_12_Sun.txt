The weather is better today,
it was I think the change
of the bad sultry cloudy
weather of yesterday on
account of the constellation
Pleyad appearing in the
early morning ~
I sent my boy Hanna
with the key of my room outside
to get some paint out ready
for the painters when they
come to work on Tuesday

At 4 P.M. I went to Sister
Eliza, & also on Sister Emilia,
my sister Eliza came then
also Johny & his sister
Guiseppina & insisted very
much on Emilia to go
& sleep with them, as she
is down below in this heat,
& she wont go; at 6 I
came home ~

When she made 10 days
