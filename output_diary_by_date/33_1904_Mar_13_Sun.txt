Sund
Light N.W. breeze & fine
pleasant Weather;
At 7 Â½ AM we went to Church
& then after the Requim, we
went to Sister Emilia, at
11 I came home, I took for
breakfast some rice soup
& boiled fish & a little Arrowroot,
with the usual Pepsine & the
Bismutho Magnesienne &
felt Alright, Yesterday in
the evening I took a little
Arak & water for the first
time & felt better ~
Antone Marine called on us
at 3 P.M. ~ I took at dinner
little Arak, & the soup and
some stewed potatoes & meat
with two spoons of Pilaw and
the arrowroot with some Citron
Jam, but I had taken too
much & so I was puffed
up & full of wind, & having
turned in at 8 so early I
suffered the indigestion
all the night the wind
troubled me awfully,
at 11 I awoke with much
wind & pain, my belly is
full & hard, ~
