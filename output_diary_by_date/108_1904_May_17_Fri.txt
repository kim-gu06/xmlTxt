Light breeze from
East, & changed to N.W. and
became cloudy; I slept well
on the terrace, ~
At 6 ½ AM. Alexander, Marie
& Cecil with the servant Habooba
& the cook Jejo went up in
a Boat to town, to clean
the Serdates & furnish them
for the Summer ~
At 8 ½ the S.S. Khalifah
passed up, she had been
refitted at Basreh for the
last two trips ~ The
wife of Elias Jejo on board
she has accompanied
her daughter down last
trip who is married to
Mr. Weber the Engineer
Rufail came to me,
also my wife came to get
the matresses & can his out
of her room & put in the
Serdates which I offered to
Rufail & the children of his
late sister Jakoory to come
& pass the midday hot
weather, for it is too hot
to stay under tents now,
the weather is so warm
nasty and sultry, with air
all around ~
I painted some door & the
Balcony, as the Tilkeply
Sadek would not work
at 25 P. a day without
food as it is usually
the case so I dispensed with
him he only worked yesterday,
Weather warm sultry
& calm; ~ It is much cooler
on top of the house, it is cloudy
every where ~
