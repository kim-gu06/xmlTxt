both left to walk down
the Keradah reach and
cross over to see the gardens
of the carmetite fortress,
as it was proposed before
we crossed over in a
fishing Terrada, we saw
the first old garden,
it is fairly good, they
have leased it for 130
Liras for two years,
but the expences take
away all the revenue,
we then walked up about
10 minutes further & came
to an other piece newly
boight for 150 Liras, but
it is not worth, then an
only 90 Date trees in it, &
a small mud enclosure
where we saw the greek
Priest son of Kallab &
about 7 or 8 Tilkefly
boys working there as
peasants, & a lot of fowels,
Rabbits, & a fine cow,
& they are living there
as hermits; we left
at 9 & had to walk up
river to catch a goffa
to ferry us, & with much
difficulty we could not
persuade the man to
cross us we were then
just opposite my house,
we had to take the goffa
by force, & he crossed us over
I then gave him one Keram
& he was much pleased,
I got to my house at 10
