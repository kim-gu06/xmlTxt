The S.S. Blosse Lynch left
at about 5 AM;
Dr. Cox the Residency Surgeon
left in the Blosse for good,
he was not so popular here,
& his profession also did not
prove to be so clever ~
A Colonel Fry of the Indian
army also left in her, he came
by last steamer to see about
the Murder & Assasinations
of the Residency Sepoys ~
At 9 Â½ I went to Mr. Rosenfeld
to take him & go to Major
New March, so as to see
about the proportion of
Money (145 T Liras) belonging
to my nephew Antone
to withdraw as he has
now entered in his Majority
(born 14 March 1884) and
consequently entitled to it
by the Austro Hungarian Law,
But Mr. Rosenfeld told me
that he is occupied now, &
perhaps this afternoon we
can go, so I came home
River has fallen about
3 feet ~
Apricots have come to
season since three days it
is selling at 50 or 60 Piast
per big Oke ~
Mr. Rosenfeld sent to tell me
with Alexander, that Major
New March does not want
to undertake the handing
over to Antone my nephew his
share of the money of 145 T Liras
from the sale of the house,
he would rather live it
until the Austrian Consul
comes, he does not want to
take responsibility of it,
& at the same time Mr.
Rosenfeld told Alexander
1904
May
that he has just recieved
a telegram from Mr. Rappaport
telling him that a new consul
has been appointed for
Baghdad & sends his salutes
to all his friends & to Major
Newmarch, he wires from
Salonica;
Alexander went down in
a goffa at 2 P.M. to my
new house I sent down
the Iron Rods & wood poles
for the railing & on the
terrace, also three Iron
Pipes for the pump;
The whole day I had some
wind in stomach & intestines &
I abstained from eating any
thing during the day so as not
to cause any worse state
like yesterday, my bowels
are costive now;
Weather cloudy all over
& gloomy with light N.W.
I have again a little nausea
& wind in stomach, at dinner
I took only the pigeon boiled
of this morning, some soup and
Leben, but I got worse at
night & could not sleep
alway inclined to vomit &
the wind troubling me,
I slept at midnight;
