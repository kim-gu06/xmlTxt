The River is falling very
little about 4 inches, the

of my wall, but the foundation
is good & deep, about 6 feet
below the soil & about 5 feet
broad ~ it is further falling
about 1 foot in all by noon,
Ali Beg has blocked up the
hole from the river preventing
its running out into the
river & so it is kept all
full & along my wall,
A sud having been caused
Off above Baghdad & the
Water spred around the
N. Eastern part of the town
& comes down as far as opposite
my house out to the left of
Ghersara road but it is not
so much as to cause any
alarm, as the river is falling
Now, it will stop where
it is ~
