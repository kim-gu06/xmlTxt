Din alright~ I am
looking for a cook

be persuaded to serve
us;~
I went to see Mr. Rosenfeld

new march had wired again
to the Ambassador at

had become of our new
Consul Mr. Jacob Weines

will be here in a month,
I saw the Bulletin of

mortality, it gives only
275 attacks & 170 deaths

times the number should
be added; Amara 18

to get a servant cook no

out on a donkey with some
Kit, & I walked out myself
from Sister Emilia’s house

he does not write to me, and
