Very light S.Ely breeze
and Cloudy all over and
dampy; ~
At 1 AM I had my bowels
worked mild & rather
billious, I felt very well
& relieved; & feel very tyred
in my legs & muscels from
the exertion I have had
here in walking up and
1904
down & this caused the
stomach getting so weak;
I took a cup of Milk, Coffee
& 2 half boiled eggs this
morning ~
We heard this morning
that poor Tooza Asfar died
last night from her long
and distressed illness,
I sent one Watchman
to town with a letter to Alexander
The S.S. Mejidieh passed
down this morning at
5 1/2 A.M. ~
The two Jew Glaciers came
down in a Goffa to put
the panes of Colored ones
in the Windows of the sitting
room & that of my wife
on the Canal, Alexander
wrote to me & sending me
a bottle of Champagne
& two Wild ducks which
Muttar our Arab old
Watchman shot 5 and
brought them, Alexander
is coming out this afternoon
Masons came to work
making parapets on top of
the house ~
Modte Cold N.W. Wind
and Cloudy all over, the
river is
still rising
falling
today of About 1 foot
Cloud Clearing off a little,
I took nothing for breakfast
except two mouthfuls of
boiled fish & little Jelly and
Arrowroot & feel better by
doing so, although the wind
is working & making noise
in my stomach. ~
Alexander wrote to me at 4
P.M. saying that he could not
come out himself, on account
of having to accompany the
funeral of Tooza Asfar at
3 1/2 P.M. to the Chaldean
Church where the body was
conveyed & she was buried
outside the town in the
Christian Cemetry. ~
I took nothing for dinner
as I do not feel inclined
the wind & diarrhea continues
My bowels worked

root ~ My Wife again got
the indigestion at night
