Light N.W. and fine weather
I feel well and quiete no pain,
I took the bitter tonic of
Nux Vomica etc; I took some
jelly & milk, but no appetite
& I am very weak yet ~
Menusha sent me yesterday
some fruit plants from her
mother's garden at Hwedir as
I had asked her to plant them
out in my new house ~
I injected first the hot water Soap
& oil & bowels worked very black
some costive but no blood
& then injected the broth with
the 2 yoke of eggs beatten together,
I feel well & little stronger,
taking nothing but jelly,
& some milk with Lime water,
Sister Emilia, Medoola,
Menusha & her daughter Louisa
called at noon and remained
until sunset ~
At sunset I made the two
injections as I did this morning
but it sent lots of wind up
to my intestines & stomach,
as the broth & egg one I keep
& does not get evaquated,
so I begun to get the pain and
it increased on & made me
very restless and miserable the
whole night ~
