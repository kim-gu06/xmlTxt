Light N.W. & fine weather
I got up at midnight &
felt hungry, so I took
1904
Feby
a little more milk & jelly,
& turned in I slept well,
At 4 ½ AM I felt that my
bowels want to work, and
it did mild & natural
this is the first time it worked
without an Enema since
more than a month; I
felt better; In the morning
I took a cup of the bitter
mixture ~ I could not take
the soup of rice at noon with
appetite, I feel rather sick
but am alright & very weak
I sent & got some flower
plants of chrisanthemns &
strawberry etc from Monseig
J. Drures garden,
At 1 P.M. my wife Alexander
the Blacksmith with my
old Pump repaired & the
Carpenter Selman & some
more plants etc all went
down in the goffa to my
new house to fix the
Pump in the Well and
plant trees etc, & to see the
rooms & return in the
evening;
Adoola my cousin & Père Anastas
called to see me ~
I have no inclination to eat
anything, but my stomach
is tranquil & quiete, the taste
in my mouth is still flat &
acrid & changeable ~
The weather is getting very
mild & pleasant, I walked
out to my room, but am too
weak to stand on my legs,
Tooza the widow of Georgis
Asfar is getting worse she
suffers besides her different
complaints & strict diet on
milk alone since two years,
from the effect of a wasp sting
on her foot since two months
& by applying different medicines
it has taken the form of a
bad ulcer & now they say
it is a gangrane, her blood
being poisoned & the Agony
is fearful which will soon
terminate her life ~

on the donkey & Alexander
on his Bicycle from my house,
The Pump is fixed in the
Well, but it does not give
sufficient water to irrigate
the garden ~
I took some rice soup in
the evening & feel well
taking also a cup of the bitter
mixture;
