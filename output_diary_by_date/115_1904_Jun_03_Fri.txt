Light S. Ely breeze prevailed
until midnight last night,
At 1 AM it suddenly shifted
to west & N.W. blowing
so strong that my bed
was flying, I was obliged
to come down below &
sleep in the room; It kept
blowing strong all the
night & the day too ~
Two Tilkefly men came
to paint my house,
I arranged with them for
five Mejidies for the whole
wood work;
My cold is very bad in
chest since three days,
it is very irritating; I
cought cold 3 days ago on
the top of the house, & having
changed my woollen flannel
into a tin cotton one,
Antoine Giulietti & Rafooli
Tanton called on me at
9 AM;
I sent Jassim the watchman
with a letter to Alexander;
he came at 11 with some vegetables
(Badinjan & Pumkins etc) &
a letter from Alexander he
tells me that my wife sent some
Kit & a box yesterday to
her brother Antoneâ€™s house,
What a foolish thing she is
doing she has recommenced
to play the same trick with
me as she did two years
ago when her daughter
Tookyeh was here, for
no cause whatever,
1904
June
we have had no quarrel lately
It appears that she does not
like to live with me & with
her son Alexander & his
wife, she slept the night
before in town at her daughter
Medoola, & would not
breakfast with Alexander
& Marie, but went to the
little house of Rufail &
sent for some Kebabs from
the bazaar etc, disgusting,
I have still a bad cold,
in chest & bones aching
& feel feverish, I am going
to sleep in the room tonight,
wind fell down & became
calm;
I dined in my room, some soup
pillaw & stewed pumkins, it
is warm in the room, but I
like it as I want to swet well;
I hear that a few cases of
Cholera took place among
the passengers on board the
Mejidieh on her way up this
time also on board the Ressafah,
I hear that Fredy DeLair
the Photographer who came up
from Bombay about six
months ago & had gone down
to Basreh died there a
few days ago, he was very
addicted to drink;
