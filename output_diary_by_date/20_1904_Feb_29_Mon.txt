Light N.W. & fine
weather ~ I feel well and
took a cupful of the bitter
1904
Feby
I took the hot milk with coffee
& an egg ~
I am preparing all my
Kit to go down tomorrow
in a Goffa to my new house
& stay there & see the Carpenter
& Masons coming to do some
more work;
Sister Medoola & Rezooki
called on us this morning;
Also Sister Eliza called this
afternoon to see me ~
I have got the Dentist
Abdulahad a Mosully to
make me two sets of false
teeth for the upper & lower
jaws & I have put them on
but I cannot stand them
they hurt my gums when
I press ~
At 6 P.M. I took some oatmeal
(porridge) & a little jelly only,
as I feel too much puffed
up, ~ my bowels also worked
this evening mild ~
At 7Â¾ P.M. the S.S. Mejidieh
arrived, I received a letter
from Rezooki Sayegh, he
has sent me two fine
Vines of black grapes;
Roofail & the children of his
late sister Tookyeh are
coming up next time in the
Mejidieh after making the
five days quarantine at
Garmat Ali, there are no
Cholera or other sickness
every two or three day, one
dies but it is not the real
Cholera, it is like Cholernie,
I again get the indigestion
at night, With lots of wind
& nausia ~
