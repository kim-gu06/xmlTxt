The S.S. Mejidieh came up from
Gherrarah last night at 5 PM.
after completing her 5 days
Quarantine ~
I feel well with no pain
but I am very weak & have
no appetite yet, I am only
taking jelly, milk or a very
little rice soup at noon;
& I felt well all the day.~
Carpenters are still Working in

When in Tramway from Kadumain

Feby
I took some jelly & the milk
for my dinner, I feel very
hungry & very weak ~
I cannot get to sleep, at
9 Â½ I took a very little Brandy
& water but it caused
much pain & wind & so
increased that I was unable
to sleep, I had to take some
of the effervescent Citrate of
Magnesia at Midnight
& it calmed the pain, I
then slept for four hours,
