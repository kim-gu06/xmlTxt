Noon 106
4 P.m107
Light N. W. breeze & fine
Our sleeping room is
desolate all cupboards
open & empty, as if robbers
or some plunder has
taken place, even a small
oval gilt mirror hang
on the wall has been taken
away, without my knowledge
and I had to send for it
so as to dress myself ~
At 8 AM I went to church
I then called on Dr Behjet
to condole him on the death
of his father Nessory three
days ago, there I saw Père
Pièrre & we rose to go away
& I went with him to church
& related to him what took
place yesterday with my
wife; he was astonished but
what could he do; I
came home my nephews
Johny Artin, my nieces
Louisa & her husband Yousif
Yaghchi, Harriette, Terrooza
& Sirpohy called on me,
I called on Menusha &
came home at 11 ~
At 5 P.M. I went over to see
Sister Emilia she spoke to
me about my wife’s doing
yesterday we talked a
good deal; At 6 I went
over to sister Eliza & spent
the evening on top of the
house on the river, ~
At 7 the SS. Phrat came
up from Basreh, having
good many passengers,
At 8 I came home,
dined on top of the terrace
& slept down below;
Light N.W. breeze and
fine weather ~
