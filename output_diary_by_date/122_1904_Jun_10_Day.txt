1904
June
to the house, so as to arrange
for the marriage of Rufail
her son with Rosa her
niecce in a fortnight more,
I took Alexander and
went to see a new house
just built the one of the
Mezrakies now the
Chaldean Church has
leased & built it, it is a
nice little house, for
25 L if taken for four
years & paid in advance,
We then went to the
Office & there came Yacoob
Eassayi Skander Aziz &
Rezooki Andria, we settled
the accounts & business of
the partnership between
Alexander & the rate Shekoory
Sayegh, by paying to the
widow Tookyeh (Sister
of Yacoob Eassayi 215
Liras of the capital
invested by Shekoory
of 300 Liras & finish all,
and Alexander accepts
all the goods left unsold
at a reduced evaluation
as well as all the outstanding
debts etc etc ~
I called on Mr. Rosenfeld
at the Austrian Consulate
there is no news of the arrival
of a New Consul yet,
& Major New March does
not want to do any
work for the Austrian
Consulate he is so lazy
& ignorant of the work
& would not interfere
anymore, he says that Mr.
Rappaport now sold him
by asking him to act in
his absence only for a few
weeks etc ~
Jew Brokers came again
to me for the purchase

the bargain for 1200 Liras
both houses; ~

I went with Abduljebbar Affendi
the Lawyer to consult him
about Alexander's arrangement
yesterday with the executors
appointed lawfully, Yacoob
Eassayi, & Skander Aziz
by the Widow of Shekoory
Sayegh; & the settlement
of the partnership between
them; It appears that he
does not approve of it,
it being rather risky
here after for Alexander
to recover all the credit
they have from merchants,
they may refuse payment
or detain it, but it
would be better for
1904
June
Alexander to let them
also be responsible for
half of the claim etc,
I then called on Metty
the Clerk of the Mejidish
(who remained behind
this trip on account of
the death of his Aunt
supposed by Cholera)
I saw Mikha the Tindal
there he is well now except
his speech, he cannot
talk well yet, it is an
Appoplectic stroke he got
& perhaps will never recover
his speech completely;
Alexander went down in
a goffa at 4 1/2 P.M., I
cannot go down because
my wife wants to come
in whenever I go out, so
I am going to stay in the
house to see what she
wants to do other things
with the house kit etc
At 5 P.M I called on Sister
Emilia, they took her last
night at Sister Emilia &
