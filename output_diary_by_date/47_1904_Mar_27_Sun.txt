Strong S. Ely wind is
blowing & cloudy, since last
night, thretening squally
weather ~
River keeps rising and
the water has entered
the Canal alongside my house
The building of Yacoob
Eassayi near my house
just above it is giving way
the ground he had filled with
hearth is opening & the
rooms which he had built
on the ground are cracking
& trembling ~
I could not go to Church
at Asfars as I have an
other boil on my right face
the one behind my neck is
better & drying up; Alexander
also did not go, not feeling
well having cought cold;
Clouds clearing off but
wind strong from S. East;
It rained very little at day break
River keeps rising & the Canal
is full & running in ~
At 2 P.M. my wife Eliza
came down in a Goffa with
her servant Zekki;
It rained at 2 P.M. a little in
large drops & is cloudy with
smooth S. Ely wind;
I ate some 3 or 4 figs & 2 dates
this afternoon & caused me great
pain & much wind so puffed
up was I that I could not breath
or move about, then I took
½ cup of tea but feel worse
much wind I passed & still it
did me no good ~
A strong signal came on
at 5 ½ the wind shifted round
to west & n,west with clouds
& thick mist all around
above & became so dark
& wind blowing very strong,

The river is Still rising,
It is now about 5 feet below
the top of the bank ~
I felt so awfully unwell, my
belly is swelled up from the
wind & pain so I could not
touch any food or soup &
had to lay down in bed &
unable to sleep, At 12, ½
After midnight I vomited
all my breakfast & the
figs I had eaten & felt then
better I slept very little
The strong wind kept all
the night cold & blowing
strong;
