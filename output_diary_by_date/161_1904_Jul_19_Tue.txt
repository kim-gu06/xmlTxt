There are some cases of Cholera
in Baghdad some people
who have imported it from
Kerkook & Salahyeh and died
here, & some have
been attacked here, In the
quarter of Hyderkhana
some cases occurred, about
15 deaths since last friday,
all the villages around
Baghdad are infected,
It is now about five months
since it broke out at
Kerbella, Basreh and
all along the Euphrates &
Tigris, its form
is so
and
the way it is working is so
different than what it
used to be in former years
it is so confusing, it is not
so virulent & infectious,
still it carries away a
person in three or four
hours ~
