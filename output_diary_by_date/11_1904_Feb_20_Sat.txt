rice soup at noon & little
jelly, it allayed it, but again
it commenced, it is an Other

me feel sick & shivers me
& I am so shaky & chilled
no Wind is passing down
& my bowels did not work
since the day before;
Alexander has been to see
Dr. Brigstocke & Dr. Nizam ed
Din & both told him to keep
to my usual diet for the present
& the use of the bitter medicine
