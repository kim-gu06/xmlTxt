Light Westerly breeze
& fine cool morning;
I sent our watchman to
town for some provision,
Alexander did not go in,
Wind shifted to n. W. at 10
Am. In the afternoon again
it shifted to west & then to
South & became calm &
unpleasant but not so
warm  as in town ~
We called on Sister medoola,
there were the wife (Tookyeh)
of Nassoory Abood, & Eliza
& Adoola my cousins,
they all then came to visit
us till sunset ~
Pleasant cool on top of the
house, but breeze from
South ~
